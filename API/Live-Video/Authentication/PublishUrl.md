# Live Authentication

## Pushing Streaming Authentication Description

###  Composition of Authentication URL

Authentication URL is composed of live pushing streaming address + check string. Check string is calculated by md5 algorithm according to authentication key + expiration time. This address is applicable to PC, mobile and third-party pushing streaming.
    
Authentication KEY: KEY parameters filled in authentication configuration by the user.
    
Valid time means that this authentication will expire if the time when a user's access time to customer origin server exceeds the customized time (**timestamp** field is designated), for example, if the valid time is 1800s and the access time set by the user is: 2020-08-15 15:00:00, the link will actually expire on: 2020-08-15 15:30:00.



### User Access Encrypted URL Composition

http://DomainName/Filename?auth_key=timestamp-rand-uid-md5hash


### Authentication Field Description

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|**timestamp**|Expiration Time, Positive Integral Number, Fixed Length 10, Seconds Since January 1, 1970. Used to Control Expiration Time, 10 Integers, Valid Time 1800s|
|**rand**|Random number, set as 0 generally|
|**uid**|Not use currently (set as 0)|
|**md5hash**|Check string worked out with the md5 algorithm, mixture of numbers and lowercase English letters 0-9a-z, with fixed length of 32|

### Verification Method

When the server gets the request, it will determine if the timestamp in the request is ahead of current time. If yes, it is deemed as expired and return HTTP 403 Error; if timestamp later than current time, a same character string will be constituted (refer to the following sstring constitution method). Then work out HashValue with MD5 algorithm and compare it with the md5hash in the request. Authentication is passed if the comparison results are consistent and the file will be returned. Otherwise, authentication fails and HTTP 403 error will be returned


### Example Description

1. Allow req_auth request target:
http://cdn.example.com/sports/football

2. Key is set as:
jdlivekeyexample123 (set by the user)

3. Authentication configuration file is expired on:
October 10, 2015, 00:00:00, amounting to 1444435200 seconds by computing

4. Server will constitute a signature character string used for computing Hashvalue:
/publishDomain/sports/football-1444435200-0-0-jdlivekeyexample123

5. Server will compute HashValue according to this signature character string
HashValue=md5sum("/publishDomain /sports/football-1444435200-0-0-jdlivekeyexample123")
=80cd3862d699b7118eed99103f2a3a4f

6. url at the request is:
http:// cdn.example.com/sports/football?auth_key=1444435200-0-0-80cd3862d699b7118eed99103f2a3a4f
The authentication is passed if the HashValue worked out is consistent with the value of md5hash = 80cd3862d699b7118eed99103f2a3a4f in the userâ€™s request.
