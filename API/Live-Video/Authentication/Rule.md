#    API Authentication Rules

##   Call Method

Live Video API has two call methods. The first method is that a customer sends an HTTP request to JD Cloud Live Video API according to the interface description and adds corresponding request parameters to the request
to complete the API call. The second method is to download the JD Cloud live management Java SDK. If you use Apache Maven to manage Java projects, you only need to
add corresponding dependencies in the pom.xml file of the project. For the specific call method of SDK, please see [SDK Call Method](https://docs.jdcloud.com/cn/live-video/api/sdk-java?content=API)
