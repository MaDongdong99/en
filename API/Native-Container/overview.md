## API
|Interface name|Request mehod|Function description|
|---|---|---|
|**associateElasticIp**|POST|The elastic IP associated with container is the elastic IP corresponding to the primary network interface and primary private IP. <br>One Virtual Machine only can be associated with one elastic IP (primary network interface). If the primary network interface has the elastic IP, the error will be returned. <br>If the user is in the blacklist, the error will be returned. <br>|
|**createContainers**|POST|Create configuration containers for one or more sets <br>- Real-name verification is required for creating containers<br>- Image<br>    \- Container images are determined through image names<br>    \- Images named as nginx:tag or mysql/mysql-server:tag are public images of docker hub<br>    \- Images named as container-registry/image:tag are images of private registry<br>    \- The private registry must be compatible to the docker registry verification mechanism and save confidential information via secret.<br>- hostname specification<br>    \- Support two methods: Write in the form of tag or in the form of a complete host name<br>    \- Tag specification<br>        \- 0-9, a-z (case insensitive) and - (minus), and the others are all invalid character string<br>        \- Neither start with a minus nor end with a minus<br>        \- At least 1 character and at most 63 characters<br>    \- A complete machine name consists of a series of tabs and dots<br>        \- Tags are connected with "."

|**createSecret**|POST|Create a secret for storing relevant confidential information of image registry. <br>|
|**deleteContainer**|DELETE|The container must have the status of stopped, running or error. <br>The instance paid by volume will keep running until it is actively deleted. The instance not used anymore can be actively stopped through this API. <br>Only the instance with the billing type by volume can be actively deleted. The container with monthly package expired can also be deleted. Please report to the ticket system for other situations. The container with billing status exception can’t be deleted. <br>|
|**deleteSecret**|DELETE|Delete a single secret<br>|
|**describeContainer**|GET|Search details of one native container<br>|
|**describeContainers**|GET|Search the detailed information of Native Container in batches<br> This API supports search in pages, with 20 entries per page by default. <br>|
|**describeQuota**|GET|Search resource quota and support: Native container pod and secret.<br>|
|**describeSecret**|GET|Search details of a single secret<br>|
|**describeSecrets**|GET|Search secret lists. <br><br>This API supports search in pages, with 20 entries per page by default. <br>|

|**getLogs**|GET|Search a single container log<br>|
|**modifyContainerAttribute**|PATCH|Modify the container name and description. <br>|
|**rebuildContainer**|POST|Reset Native Container, and use new image resetting for existing Native Container. <br> The id of the original container doesn’t change, doesn’t involve billing changes, and doesn’t support modification of instance type families for the time being, won’t change the physical node of Native Container, and doesn’t support modification of used system disks, data disks as well as network-related parameters as well. <br>- Image<br>    \- Container images are determined through image names<br>    \- Images named as nginx:tag or mysql/mysql-server:tag are public images of docker hub<br>    \- Images named as container-registry/image:tag are images of private registry<br>    \- The private registry must be compatible to the docker registry verification mechanism and save confidential information via secret<br>- Others<br>    \- Before rebuild, the container must be in off status<br>    \- After rebuild, the container is still in off status<br>|
|**resizeTTY**|POST|Adjust the TTY size <br>|
|**startContainer**|POST|Start a single container in the off status and the container involved a job can’t be started. <br>When the container instance or a cloud disk associated with it is defaulting, the container will not be normally started. <br>|
|**stopContainer**|POST|Stop a single instance in the operating status and the container involved in a job can’t be started. <br>|
