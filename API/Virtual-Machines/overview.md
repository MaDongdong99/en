## API
|Interface name|Request mehod|Function description|
|---|---|---|
|**associateElasticIp**|POST|The elastic IPs must be associated with the primary private IPs under the primary network interfaces of the Virtual Machines. <br></br>One Virtual Machine only can be associated with one elastic IP (primary network interface). If the primary network interface has the elastic IP, the error will be returned. <br></br>|
|**attachDisk**|POST|One data disk (cloud disk) can be attached with one Virtual Machine only when both the Virtual Machine and the cloud disk have no running task. <br></br>The Virtual Machines must be in the<b>running</b>or<b>stopped</b>status. <br></br>The Virtual Machines of which the local disks (local type) serve as the system disks can be attached with 8 data disks, while the Virtual Machines of which the cloud disks (cloud type) serve as the system disks can be attached with 7 data disks. </br>|
|**attachNetworkInterface**|POST|The Virtual Machines shall be attached with one Elastic Network Interface. <br></br>The operation can be made only when Virtual Machines are in the <b>running</b> or <b>stopped</b> status and have no running tasks. <br></br>If the public IP is associated with the Elastic Network Interface, then az of such public IP shall be consistent with the az of the Virtual Machines. Or, if the public IP belongs to all AZs, the attaching can be made. <br></br>The number of the Elastic Network Interfaces attached to the Virtual Machines cannot exceed restrictions to the instance type. Search<a href=”http://docs.jdcloud.com/virtual-machines/api/describeinstancetypes”>DescribeInstanceTypes</a> the APIs to obtain the count quota of the Elastic Network Interfaces attached to the specified specification. <br></br>The Elastic Network Interface and the Virtual Machines must be under the same vpc. </br>|

|**createImage**|POST|Create a private image for the virtual machine. The virtual machine status must be <b>stopped</b>. <br></br>The creation of an image is only available when there is no task in progress for virtual machine. <br></br>Image is created based on system disk backup. The whole-machine image can be created by fully or partially attaching data disk (If no changes are made, then the whole-machine image is created by default).
