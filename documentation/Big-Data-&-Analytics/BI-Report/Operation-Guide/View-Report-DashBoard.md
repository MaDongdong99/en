## Data Linkage

* Link Data by Filter Components

When you notice the abnormal profit data of mocha coffee in the eastern market, you can filter the products data and only review
the total profits, profit distribution, detailed data, and trends over two years of mocha coffee.
On the list of filter components, only check the mocha coffee, leaving the other products unchecked. In this way, all the components in the report only show data related to mocha
coffee, as shown below.
From the chart, you can see that although the profits of mocha coffee have generally increased in the national market, yet the profit is negative in the eastern market.
And judging from the profit map, it is precisely because of the negative profits of mocha coffee in Anhui and Shandong that the product suffer losses in the eastern market.
* Link Data by Scaling

So, is mocha coffee not popular with the market? Or is the profit of most products in this market not as good as that of other markets? The scaling
tool can filter out useless information and help you focus on profits in Shandong and Anhui markets.

1. In the profit map, press and hold the key Ctrl, select the two provinces of Anhui and Shandong with your mouse and click the scaling
button outside the chart area.
2. In the report, all components only show data of the two provinces, and data for the other regions are no longer displayed.
When only data for these two provinces are shown, you can see that, similar to the mocha coffee profit trend, the total profit of the other products has generally increased in the past two
years. However, reviewing the profit breakdown data of other products in these two provinces, you can find that scented mint tea is also
in the red. So is the profitability of scented mint tea similar to that of mocha coffee?

* Link Data by Brush

In order to study the profitability of scented mint tea in the eastern market, you need to use the brush tool based on the data scaling. The brush will highlight the scented mint tea data to help you find the answer.
1. Select the cell of "Scented mint tea" in the profit statement and click the brush button in the chart area.
2. In the trend chart and map, the data related to "Scented mint tea" are highlighted. In the instrument and statement, only the product
data are shown, and data for other products are no longer displayed.

When the profit of scented mint tea is highlighted, you can find that it is only sold in Anhui, with negative profit, and it is
not sold in Shandong. Moreover, unlike the steady rise in profits of other products, the scented mint tea has been in the red
since being put into market, with increasing loss over the past two years.
