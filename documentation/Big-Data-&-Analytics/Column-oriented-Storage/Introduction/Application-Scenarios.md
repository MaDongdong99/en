# Application Scenarios

The applicable scenarios for Column-oriented Storage are described as below.
 
## IoT Big Data
	Scenarios are naturally applicable to the IoT for HBase, such as bicycle class and logistics track class.

 
## Big Data Class

	Meet the specific scenarios such as security risk control, big data processing, and search, generally combine with the stream system and off-line stream



## Big data storage class, including historical data storage
	Mass data storage

	Storage includes various classes of data, such as log, order, transaction data, and message, on-line real-time writing in, in real-time query. Queries for historical data are low in batch and require hierarchical storage, and cloud HBase is expected to support separate storage of cold and hot data in December to reduce storage costs

## Real-time Analysis Class 

	Under the data bulk of ten billions, the data is returned at the second level, which is suitable for demands such as report and statistics
