# Product Overview

Column-oriented Storage is a column-oriented distributed database based on Hadoop, which is 100% compatible with the HBase Protocol and has high performance and auto scaling, and it supports PB-level big data storage easily so as to meet ten million-level QPS high-throughput random read and write scenarios.

 

## Column-oriented Storage products have the following characteristics:

High reliability storage engine	 Distributed cluster architectures and at least three such architectures ensure data reliability.
Service high availability	 With HA real-time monitoring system, the failure of single node is transferred quickly, ensuring that the service is not interrupted.
Compatible with ecological products	 Support phoenix and openTSDB.

 

## Customer scenario:
IoT Big Data
	Scenarios are naturally applicable to the IoT for HBase, such as bicycle class and logistics track class.

 
Big Data Class

	Meet the specific scenarios such as security risk control, big data processing, and search, generally combine with the stream system and off-line stream



Big data storage class, including historical data storage
	Mass data storage

	Storage includes various classes of data, such as log, order, transaction data, and message, on-line real-time writing in, in real-time query. Queries for historical data are low in batch and require hierarchical storage, and cloud HBase is expected to support separate storage of cold and hot data in December to reduce storage costs

Real-time Analysis Class 

	Under the data bulk of ten billions, the data is returned at the second level, which is suitable for demands such as report and statistics
