#### 3 Configuration of Basic Chart Component

At present, the Data Visualization provides 29 basic statistical charts, such as the line chart, the column diagram, the bar chart, the pie chart, the bubble chart, the scatter diagram, the hydrograph and the dashboard.

The charts are similar to each other with respect of style and data configuration. Three major settings are comprised basically, including:
the global font and chart position setting, the coordinate axis setting (X/Y/polar axis) and the data series and legend setting.

###### 3.1.7 Column Diagram, Line Chart and Box Plot-data Series

Data series refer to specific component contents to be displayed via the data. The user can control the business data to be displayed by the chart via the adding and deleting options.

For example: three business data types, including the rice, the wheat and the corn, are displayed in the figure below.

![](https://github.com/jdcloudcom/cn/blob/edit/image/Data-Visualization/media/6d9e6aa43693a915cef5d51f97aeccc0.png)


Adding data series: Three data types, including the K line chart (box plot), the polyline chart and the column diagram, can be associated to each data series.
Once the data series adding button is clicked by the user, the system will add a configuration item of a data series by default in order. For example, where the current chart already has 3 data series, the added data series type value is 4 by default. The business data with the series value 4 will be displayed in the chart only if such business data are contained in the userâ€™s configuration data. Otherwise, no business data will be displayed.

![](https://github.com/jdcloudcom/cn/blob/edit/image/Data-Visualization/media/e2670305307a4cb7f2dfe0ef823ba8c8.png)


Association between data series and data: The user can map the data into the chart via the series value consistent with the data. If the series values set by the user are inconsistent with the data, the data will not be displayed in the chart. Similarly, if the data are not maintained in the series, the data will not be in the chart.

![](https://github.com/jdcloudcom/cn/blob/edit/image/Data-Visualization/media/2e12b5eace9739124ec8dbb6df0a2d63.png)


Style setting of graph data: The user can determine whether to display the column diagram, the polyline chart and the K line chart (box plot) or not, and set chart style details such as modifying weight, color and others of the column diagram. Effects of the polyline chart and the column diagram are as shown in the figure below.
