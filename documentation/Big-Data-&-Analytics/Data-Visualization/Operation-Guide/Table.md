##### 3.4 List/List View

The system provides two list types, including the single-indicator list and the multi-indicator list. The single-indicator list only has series number column and the data column, while the multiple-indicator list only allows any indicators added by the user. The indicator and indicator value will be displayed in the form of fold for the single-indicator list. Each column of the multi-indicator list represents a data indicator type.

For style setting, both the lists cover: the global style, the outline border style, the header style setting, the line style setting, the SN column style setting and the data column style setting.

You are allowed to set list font, display rows of list and scrolling animations in the Global Settings.

The outline border and the header are optional, which can be controlled via the display frame. You are allowed to modify the line color and width of the outline border as well as the header font.

The line configuration is mainly used for configuring the background color and the cutting line of each line.

Configurations of the SN line and the data column are basically the same, both of which comprise setting of column width and font.

You need to upload data in form of list. The order set forth in the list is the data upload order.
