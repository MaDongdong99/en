##### 2.4 Enter Data Visualization Screen Edition Workbench

Upon creating the Visualization Screen, the user may enter the Data Visualization Workbench. The workbench can be divided into 4 areas, including a visualization screen canvas area in the middle, a tool bar on the top, a layer area on the left and a chart/canvas configuration area on the right.

-   The canvas area is the container of all components and also the Data Visualization to be created.

-   The tool bar is the menu bar for selecting components of the visualization screen.

-   The layer area is used for managing all components in the canvas.

-   Chart/Canvas Configuration Area. You can configure attributes of the canvas and each chart here.

###### 2.4.1 Canvas Setting

Canvas setting is to define physical device parameters to be projected to the Visualization Screen.

Upon click the blank region outside the black canvas, the canvas attribute to be maintained will be displayed on the right configuration area.

For example, bring the background image of the visualization screen to the bottom. You can adjust position of components (text-align: top, text-align: bottom, text-align: left, text-align: right, text-align: center and vertical-align: center).
