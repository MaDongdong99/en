##### 3.5 Date-Heat Map

The date-heat map is a heat map drawn in the rectangular coordinate system, wherein the data of the X/Y axis can be any entries.

The style setting of heat map covers the Global Settings and the X/Y axis and Data Area Setting. The configuration items for the Global Settings and the X/Y axis are as the same as those of the basic chart. You need to map the indicator value and the component color in the data area setting.

For the data configuration of the heat map, you need to provide (X,Y,VALUE) for each data block, among which the X axis and Y axis
refer to positions of business data in the rectangular coordinate system, and Value refers to the thermodynamic value of business data.
