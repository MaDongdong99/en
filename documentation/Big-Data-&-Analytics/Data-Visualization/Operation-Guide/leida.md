##### 3.3 Radar Chart

The radar chart supports the round radar chart and the polyline radar chart. The style setting covers the polar axis setting, the style of radar chart, the data tag style and the data series style.

You are allowed to adjust the maximum scale value of each axis for the polar axis of the radar chart. If the maximum scale is not maintained, the system will set the maximum scale for the axis based on the maximum value of data. In addition, you also can adjust color and font weight of axis, font of scale value, etc.

The style setting of radar chart mainly comprises setting of cutting lines and partitions. Numbers of cutting lines and partitions can be adjusted by adjusting the scale number of polar axes.

The data tag and the data series are the indications of business data in the radar chart. You are allowed to adjust attributes of data areas, such as outline border, filling and subtracting color and tag field. The radar chart also supports display of multi-series data. You are allowed to add several business options in the data series.

You need to associate the data series (S) and the statistical dimension. S refers to the data series intended to be described. The indicator item is the statistical dimension of the data series. S is a reserved word which must be marked with the fixed character S in the associated data. When the data are read by the system, S will be used as the business description (series name), while other data will be used as the statistical dimension. In addition, the radar chart also supports the renaming function to the statistical dimension.
