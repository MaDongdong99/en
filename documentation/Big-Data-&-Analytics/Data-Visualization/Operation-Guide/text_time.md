##### 5.2 Timer and Countdown Timer

The timer is used to display the current system time, and you can customize a start time. The system will start timing as per this time. The timer does not require setting data or interactions.

If you want to use the countdown timer, you need to associate cut-off time for timing in data settings. The Data Visualization will count down according to the current system time and the cut-off time.
