	   -  When purchasing a cloud service, it is recommended to choose the region closest to your customer to reduce the access delay;
2. On the cluster management page, click **Create** to enter the creation page.

	1. Software Setup
	
	   Instructions:
	   -  High availability is enabled. The cluster will have two Masters: Active Namenode and Standby Namenode: two Namenodes form a mutual standby, one is in the Active state and is the primary Namenode, and the other is in the Standby state. It is the Namenode and only the master. The Namenode can provide read and write services to the outside;
	   -  Do not enable high availability, the cluster has a Master by default;
	   -  JD MapReduce_BD-OS-1.0 version selects high availability by default when creating a cluster;
