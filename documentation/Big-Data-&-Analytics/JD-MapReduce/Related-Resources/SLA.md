However, the service unavailable time caused by the following reasons is not included:

(1) Caused by the system maintenance procedures after JD Cloud Digivoice Big Data Analysis Platform's notification in advance, including cutting, maintenance, upgrading and simulated failure drill;

(2) Packet loss and delay caused by operators' failure;

(3) Caused by the hackers' hacking to the users' application programs or data information;

(4) Caused by the loss or leakage of data, commands, passwords etc. due to user's improper maintenance or improper confidentiality measures;

(5) caused by the user upgrading the operating system by himself;

(6) caused by the user's application or installation activities;

(8) Force majeure and accidents;

(9) Caused by other non-JD Cloud Digivoice Big Data Analysis Platform reansons.

4.2 Compensation Standard Principles

* Failure time = failure resolution time-failure start time. Calculate the failure time in minute, and calculate the failure time as one minute when the failure time is less than one minute. For example, if the failure time is 1 minute and 01 second, calculate as per 2 minutes.

Platform failure of JD Cloud Digivoice big data is compensated by 100 times:

The way of compensation is to extend the usage time of big data service, extension time = failure time * 100.
