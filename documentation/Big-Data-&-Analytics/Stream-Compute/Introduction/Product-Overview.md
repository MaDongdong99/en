# Introduction<br>
## Product Overview<br>
The business value of data is rapidly reduced with the loss of time. Therefore, it must be calculated and processed as soon as possible after the data is generated. Jingdong Stream Compute products are streaming big data analysis platforms running on JD Cloud platform, which are provided to users a tool for real-time analysis of streaming data on the cloud. <br>
Stream Compute is a real-time data processing and analysis platform in a big data scenario. It supports users to compile data processing operations in SQL mode, reduces the threshold of streaming data development, and helps users quickly build stream processing applications. Stream Compute supports cleaning, statistical summary, and data analysis of real-time data, automatically integrating the Stream Hub as an input stream, and processed results sent to a Data Compute or cloud storage for data persistence storage. <br><br>
<br>
**Real-time Data Cleaning, Statistical Summary, and Data Analysis**<br>
- Providing an interactive SQL editor that supports debugging and optimization of scripts to quickly build complex stream processing applications. <br><br>

**Automatic Integration**<br>
- Seamless integration of streaming data centers and Data Computes<br>
The automatic integration stream data center is used as an input stream, and the processed results are sent to the Data Compute for persistence. <br><br>

**Auto Scaling**<br>
- Customize operations, calculate cluster auto scaling<br>
Automatically expand or shrink the resources required by running a streaming application based on operation matching data throughput.
