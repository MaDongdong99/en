## About Stream Compute<br>
I.	About Streaming Data<br>
Streaming data is a group of sequential, large, fast, and continually arriving data sequences. In general, a data stream can be viewed as a dynamic data set that grows indefinitely over time. Compared with offline data, stream data is commonly smaller. The produced source of streaming data comes from an inexhaustible events stream, such as generated log files by customers using your mobile or web application procedures, online shopping data, in-game player activity, social networking site information, and telemetry data comes from connected devices or instruments in the data center. <br><br>
Characteristics of Streaming Data: <br>
1) Data can arrive in real time;<br>
2) Data’s arrival order is independent without being controlled by system’s application;<br>
3) The scale of data is large and its maximum value cannot be predicted;<br><br>
II. About Stream Compute<br>
Stream Compute is good at performing real-time analysis regarding the large-scale streaming data during its ever-changing movement process, capturing potentially useful information and sending the results to the next computing node<br>
