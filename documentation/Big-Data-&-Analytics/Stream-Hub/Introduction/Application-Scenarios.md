## Application Scenarios<br>
**Real-time Data Analysis**<br>
Stream Compute is a Stream Compute engine provided by the JD Cloud, which provides a language similar to SQL for the computation and analysis of streaming data. Stream Hub and Stream Compute can be seamlessly combined to facilitate the import and export of data, and at the same time can be used as a data source for Data Compute. <br>
<br>
**Accelerated log and data source import and processing**<br>
You can push data directly into the stream, for example, push systems and application logs, which can be processed in seconds. This can prevent log data loss due to front-end or application server failures. <br>
