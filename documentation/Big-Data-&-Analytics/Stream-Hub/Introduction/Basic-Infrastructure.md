JD Cloud Streaming data Bus is a streaming data processing platform that provides the function to publish, subscribe and distribute streaming data, so that you can easily build analysis and applications based on streaming data. <br>\
<br>
The Stream Hub service can continuously collect and store a large amount of streaming data generated by various mobile devices, application software, website services, sensors, and the like. You can use Stream Compute products to process streaming data written to the Stream Hub, such as Real-time reports, real-time statistics, and online recommendations. <br>
