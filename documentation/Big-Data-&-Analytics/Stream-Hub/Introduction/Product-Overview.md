## Stream Hub Overview<br>
The Stream Hub is a scalable, distributed, high-throughput messaging service for big data scenarios, providing low-latency message publish and subscribe function to help users quickly build the analysis and applications of streaming data. <br>
<br>
The Stream Hub is capable of receiving and processing millions of data and messages per second, and can store and process data sent to the Stream Hub by distributed software and devices, and due to the ability to provide publish / subscribe function at a low latency and on a very high scale, the Stream Hub can serve as a data service entry of the big data, and the data collected in the Stream Hub can be consumed and used by the downstream service application, such as real-time data processing by Stream Compute products; meanwhile, the data stored in the Stream Hub can be stored in JD Cloud Storage, data warehouse and other products for persistent storage of data for future analysis. <br>
<br>
**What can the Stream Hub be used for:**
<br>
Streaming data centers can track data in the Internet of Things, collect user click stream logs from web sites, capture in-game events on TV or in games, or collect IoT data from industrial machines, interconnected cars, or other devices. <br>
<br>
**Benefits from Using Stream Hub:**<br>
Putting data into the Stream Hub ensures persistence and resiliency. The latency between the time the record is placed in the stream and the time the record can be consumed is typically less than 1 second, which means that you can start using the data in the Stream Hub almost immediately after adding the data. At the same time, the flexibility of the Stream Hub allows you to expand or shrink the stream so that you never lose them before the data records expire. <br>
