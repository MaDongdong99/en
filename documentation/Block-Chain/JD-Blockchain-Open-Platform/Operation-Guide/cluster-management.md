# Feature Introduction of Cluster Page
This feature is designed for convenient and quick experience of the platform features by users. This page will only display when a user logs in and the user is found not to have completely created his/her new cluster or create the first block chain network.

You must enter a cluster name when creating the cluster and select the cluster configuration. During the beta, the cluster configuration only has the basic configuration option. Then you click **Cluster Creation** button to successfully create the cluster.
