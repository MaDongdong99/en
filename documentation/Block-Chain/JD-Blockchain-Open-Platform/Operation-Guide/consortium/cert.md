# Certificate Management
In JD Cloud Version, the system will automatically establish some certificates after completion of chain building. However, the certificates at each node shall be manually established by network creators in accordance with the quantity of nodes. The certificate name must be consistent with the node name. For example, if only one node has been selected, the node name is peer0, while if four nodes have been selected, the names of the nodes shall be peer0, peer1, peer2, peer3. The list of all certificates can be viewed upon the opening of certificate management tab page on which the details of the certificates can be viewed or downloading of the certificates can be conducted. In case that a new certificate needs to be applied, the application can be carried out by clicking **Apply Certificate** button on the certificate management tab page. Meanwhile, certificates meeting name requirements can be searched by entering the name of certificate and clicking **Search** button.
