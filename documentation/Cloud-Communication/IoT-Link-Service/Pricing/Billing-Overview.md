# Billing Overview
## I. Commodity Pricing
Depending on the specification selection on the commodity details, the unit price will differ.

* **IoT Card Attribute**:

IoT card refers to the medium specially used for IoT devices

* **Traffic Package**

Traffic package refers to the data traffic that can be used for mobile data communication of IoT devices

The size of different traffic package is a factor determining the unit price
## I. Mandatory Activation
China Mobile: If the IoT Connection Service is not used within 3 months after being purchased, it will be activated mandatorily on the 1st day of the next month after the above 3 months

China Unicom: If the IoT Connection Service is not used within 3 months after being purchased, it will be activated mandatorily on the 1st day of the next month after the above 3 months

China Telecom: If the IoT Connection Service is not used within 3 months after being purchased, it will be activated mandatorily on the 1st day of the next month after the above 3 months
## III. Account Cancellation Rules
China Mobile: If no new traffic package is ordered within 90 natural days after the traffic package is expired, the IoT Connection Service will be canceled

China Unicom: If no new traffic package is ordered within 90 natural days after the traffic package is expired, the IoT Connection Service will be canceled

China Telecom: If no new traffic package is ordered within 90 natural days after the traffic package is expired, the SIM card will be canceled
## IV. Type of Shared Traffic at the Same Level
1. IoT Connection Services with packages at the same level constitute a shared traffic pool, and only the traffic of monthly packages at the same level are shared, e.g. ten 1G cards constitute a 10G traffic pool

2. The network won’t be cut off to any IoT Connection Service after any certain traffic is reached, and when the overall usage exceeds the total of the shared pool, the excessive traffic will be calculated as cost beyond packages

3. No superimposing packages can be ordered and no packages can be changed for shared packages at the same level. Only renewal at the current level is supported

4. Pay-In-Advance for Traffic Package Within Package, Pay-As-You-Go for Traffic Beyond Package
