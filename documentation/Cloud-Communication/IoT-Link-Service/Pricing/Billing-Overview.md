2. The network won’t be cut off to any card after any certain traffic is reached, and when the overall usage exceeds the total of the shared pool, the excessive traffic will be calculated in accordance with fees beyond packages.

3. No superimposing packages can be ordered and no packages can be changed for shared packages at the same level. Only renewal at the current level is supported

4. Pay-In-Advance for Traffic Package Within Package, Pay-As-You-Go for Traffic Beyond Package
