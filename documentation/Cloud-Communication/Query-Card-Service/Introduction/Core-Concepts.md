# Core Concepts
- **Single Card General Traffic**

The traffic of each IoT card is independent. For example: If you purchase the package of “1G traffic/month”, the 1G traffic will become invalid at 23:59:59 on the last day of the month, and if you use up the 1G traffic in advance, the network will be cut off automatically.
- **Shared Traffic at the Same Level**

1. Single cards with packages at the same level constitute a shared traffic pool, and only the traffic of monthly packages at the same level are shared, e.g. ten 1G cards constitute a 10G traffic pool

2. The network won’t be cut off to any card after any certain traffic is reached, and when the overall usage exceeds the total of the shared pool, the excessive traffic will be calculated in accordance with fees beyond packages.

3. No superimposing packages can be ordered and no packages can be changed for shared packages at the same level. Only renewal at the current level is supported
