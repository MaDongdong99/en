If you urgently need to use the SMS function, please contact the customer service staff to accelerate the audit speed; if it is unapproved, you can also contact the customer service staff for detailed communication.<br>
As for the content template having passed the audit, it doesn’t indicate that it is bound to be issued successfully (there is also a spot check audit mechanism on the operator side). The customer service staff can be contacted for detailed communication, in case failed sending of SMS.<br><br>
