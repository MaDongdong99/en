# FAQ

**Q: The IP access of which regions is supported by Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro?**

A: Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro supports IP access of all regions, including JD Cloud and users outside the Cloud.

**Q: Which forwarding protocols does Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro support?**

A: Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro supports the forwarding setting of protocols including TCP, UDP, HTTP and HTTPS, and supports websocket protocol access, covering all business scenarios.

**Q: What are the differences between non-web service forwarding and web service forwarding?**

A: The two forwarding settings correspond to different application scenarios and usage protocols. Specific differences are as follows:
- Non-web service: Mainly applied to business scenarios such as games, e-commerce, finance, APP, etc.; supported protocols: TCP protocol and UDP protocol.

Provides 3 to 4 layers of SYN Flood, ACK Floods, ICMP Flood, UDP Flood, NTP Floods, SSDP Flood and other attacks protection. The DDoS protection for application layer is not supported.
- Web Service: Mainly applied to Web Service business. Supported protocols: http/https protocol; supports websocket access, port accesses of 80 and 443, and non-standard port access.

In addition to providing SYN Flood, ACK Floods, ICMP Flood, UDP Flood, NTP Floods, SSDP Flood and other attacks protection, it also supports application-layer protection against attacks such as CC attacks, HTTP Flood, etc.

**Q: What ISP lines does Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro support?**

A: Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro supports single and multiple ISP line purchase, and supports the single ISP line to upgrade to multi ISP lines.
- Single ISP line: The China Telecom's ISP line can support up to 400G of protection bandwidth.

- Multi ISP line: There are two optionalISP lines: Telecom + Unicom and Telecom + Unicom +CMCC, supporting up to 400G of protection bandwidth.

By default, the China Telecom's ISP line will be resolved to the China Telecom Machine Room, the China Unicom's ISP line to the China Unicom Machine Room, and the CMCC's ISP line to the CMCC Machine Room. If the attack traffic exceeds the maximum capacity of China Unicom Machine Room or CMCC Machine Room, the ISP line will be resolved to the China Telecom's ISP line to complete the cleaning.


**Q: Does Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro support extensive domains?**

A: In Web Service forwarding rules configuration of Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro, it supports the protection of the extensive domains.

Extensive domain name resolution refers to the use of wildcard (*) as secondary domain name to enable all secondary domain names to point to the same IP. For example, it supports configurating *.jdcloud.com.


**Q: What is business bandwidth, and what happens it is exceeded?**

A: Business bandwidth purchased by Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro is for the entire instance, meaning the bandwidth in the IN or OUT direction of all normal traffic for the instance.

In default, Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro gifts 100M business bandwidth, and if it is exceeded, it would trigger traffic speed limit, which may lead to random data loss. If the bandwidth goes beyond the business bandwidth, the system will send alarm notification and recommend you upgrade it timely.

**Q: What are the requirements for access to domains of Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro?**

A: According to relevant laws and regulations of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro only protects filed domains. If the domain is not filed, the Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro service will not be available.

**Q: What is the main business of CC defense?**

A: CC defense is mainly for Web Service business, and is closed by default. CC defense does not take effect when closed.

After turning on the main switch, all the domains of this instance will turn on CC defense, and you can manually close the domains that do not require CC defense.

**Q: Why would a black hole occur?**

A: When the attack traffic reaches the upper limit of the Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro package that you purchase, a black hole will be triggered and shield all access to the server.

It is recommended that you buy a better protection packages for greater protection. After the package has been upgraded, the system will automatically become unbanned in seconds.

**Q: How long will the black hole be lasting, and how to unban it?**

A: By default of the black hole policy of Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro, it would last for 2 hours. If the server has not been attacked in 2 hours, it will automatically become unbanned.

The duration before the server is unbanned is related to the number of times the black hole is triggered and the peak value of the attack. If the server continues to receive attack, the duration of the ban will continue to lengthen.

If the attack traffic so excessive that the operator's ban is triggered, the duration of the ban is determined by the operator's policy and becomes uncertain.

**Q: What error status codes does advanced protection support?**

A: Advanced protection sets up error code pages for the following special cases, and you can view and troubleshoot the problems according to the prompt on the page.

| Error Code	| Meaning	| Reasons for Occurring | What to do |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|ERROR 422 |	Access denied | 	Sorry, the webmaster has performed identity and access management to the region you are in or the access IP and denied your access because of possible malicious behavior on your computer or IP. |	Please contact the webmaster to modify the access policy. |
|ERROR 420 |	Request to re-enter |	The same access from you has passed though the node of Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro of JD. |	Please confirm the website configuration, and confirm whether it is configured with multiple proxy servers, and the proxy path has generated loop. |
|ERROR 522 |	The origin server is unreachable	. The same access from you has passed though the node of Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro of JD. |F	or errors occurring to the origin server, the common causes are DNS setting error, changes have not taken effect or origin server firewall |The request is blocked.

**Q: What is backup IP? What's the benefit of configuring a backup IP?**

A: The backup IP is the standby to the back-to-source IP. The definitions are as follows:

Back-to-source IP: Refers to the back-to-source address of advanced protection in case of attacks, which can be an IP address or a domain. It is recommended that the back-to-source IP be externally invisible.

Backup IP: Refers to the back-to-source IP address of advanced protection in case of non-attack state. It is an externally visible backup IP. Backup IP is not mandatory.

The benefits of configuring backup IP are:

- When the user's normality is not at the advanced protection, the traffic will reach the backup IP address. When the normality is ensured, the service delay will be lower and the access will be faster; only when attacked will JD Cloud Intelligent Dispatching Center dispatch traffic to advanced protection for filter and cleaning, before forwarding clean traffic to the source station.
- The IP of normal use is separated from the back-to-source IP. This effectively improves the user's business availability.

As an example of non-web service settings, the schematic diagram is as follows:

You can expand the “Product Graphic Instructions” on the Instance Details page to view the diagram.

Eg：

The back-to-origin IP address is 100.10.10.1 and the backup IP address is 100.10.10.2. The back-to-origin/defense status bar can be switched according to the network status.

- In the normal status, please select back-to-origin in the “Back-to-origin/Defense Status" bar, then the traffic will directly point to the backup IP address 100.10.10.2;
- When an attack is found, switch to Defense in the “Back-to-origin/Defense Status" bar, and the traffic will go to the IP address 100.10.10.1 through back-to-origin after being cleaned by high defense.


**Q: Does Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro support non-80-port website access?**

A: It supports. Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro supports custom port to meet access requirements for the non-standard-port Web Service business.

**Q: What is an HTTP back-to-source?**

A: As shown in the figure below, after the HTTP back-to-source is turned on, it returns to server via Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro and will be translated into the protocol back-to-source of HTTP. The back-to-source port used by default is 80.
![](https://github.com/jdcloudcom/cn/blob/edit/image/Advanced%20Anti-DDoS/HTTP%20rule%2001.png)

If the port is customized by HTTP, the port back-to-source of custom port will be used.
