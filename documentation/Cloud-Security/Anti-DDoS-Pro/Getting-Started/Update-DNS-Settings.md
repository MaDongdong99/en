# Update DNS Resolution

After this step is completed, all users' access traffic will be forwarded back to the user's source station after being through Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro.

## Precondition
- The Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro has been successfully purchased and the billing status is normal. <Br/>
- All Forwarding Settings have been completed and been verified to take effect.

## Operation Steps
1. Log in [Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro Console](https://ip-anti-console.jdcloud.com/instancelist).
2. On the "Instance List" page, select the target instance, then click **Instance Name** or **Forwarding Setting** to enter the Instance Details page. Copy the cname value to be modified in the web service or non-web service forwarding rule. <Br/>
Take non-web service forwarding rules as an example, find the cname to be copied at the red box as follows:
![Modify DNS](https://github.com/jdcloudcom/cn/blob/edit/image/Advanced%20Anti-DDoS/update%20dns%2001.png)
3. At the provider of domain, you need to modify the domain name resolution configuration to resolve the domain name to the IP of Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro.
Take the "Cloud Resolution" of JD Cloud as an example, on **Console** –>> **Domain Name Service** –>> **Cloud Resolution**, enter JD Cloud [Cloud Resolution Console](https://dns-console.jdcloud.com/list). <Br/>
![Modify DNS](https://github.com/jdcloudcom/cn/blob/edit/image/Advanced%20Anti-DDoS/update%20dns%2002.png) <Br/>
Find the domain name to be resolved, as follows:
![Modify DNS](https://github.com/jdcloudcom/cn/blob/edit/image/Advanced%20Anti-DDoS/update%20dns%2003.png) <Br/>
Click to enter the resolution configuration:
![Modify DNS](https://github.com/jdcloudcom/cn/blob/edit/image/Advanced%20Anti-DDoS/update%20dns%2004.png) <Br/>
Change the record value to the cname address of Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro.


## Special Instructions
- If the ** return/defense ** status in the forwarding rules is a back-to-source, the access traffic will not be to the advanced protection, but directly to the source station.
