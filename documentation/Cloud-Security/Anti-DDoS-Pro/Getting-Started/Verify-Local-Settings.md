This step **is not mandatory** 
<Br/>But to maximize the stability of your business, we recommend that you conduct a local test before you modify DNS resolution.

## Precondition

## Local Test Procedures
1. Log in to any one Linux server;</br>
2. Enter the following contents at the command line:</br>
curl -x cname:port DomainName
<Br/>E.g.: <Br/>
