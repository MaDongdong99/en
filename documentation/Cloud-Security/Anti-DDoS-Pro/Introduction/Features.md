- Supports advanced Web Service configurations such as non-standard port access, HTTP address forcible back-to-origin, HTTP visit jump, etc.

### 4. Flexible Protection Billing Scheme
- Supports elastic protection. Saves costs for you by billing by the actual attack bandwidth.

### 5. Quick Access
- Enables quick access to Anti-DDoS Pro services in cname-based manner.

### 6. Massive Attack Protection
- Supports Telecom+Unicom+CMCC's ISP line, 400G of maximum single ISP line capability, total defense capability of T level.

### 7. Accurate Report Display
- Provides you with a comprehensive understanding of Anti-DDoS Pro services by presenting demonstrations such as DDoS attack reports, forwarding traffic, CC reports, etc.

### 8. Covered common attack types, see the following table:
