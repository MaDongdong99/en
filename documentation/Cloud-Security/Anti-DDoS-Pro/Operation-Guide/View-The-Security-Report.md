## Report Type
Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro reports are classified into three categories: DDoS attack protection, forwarding traffic and CC defense. By default, the report on display is the one of that day. You may change it to display reports of 7 days and 30 days. You can view the reports of up to 30 days, with the minimum report size being 5 minutes. The report issue is the display of attack log.

3. CC Defense Report</BR>
Advanced Anti-DDoS Pro defends CC attack and a CC defense report will be produced. CC report supports switching between different domains.</BR>
Because CC defense only takes effect on the Web Service, of all CC defense reports, only the Web Service forwarding rules can produce CC defense traffic.
