## Report Type
Anti-DDoS Pro reports are classified into three categories: DDoS attack protection, forwarding traffic and CC defense. By default, the report on display is the one of that day. You may change it to display reports of 7 days and 30 days. You can view the reports of up to 30 days, with the minimum report size being 5 minutes. The report issue is the display of attack log.</BR>

1. Report of DDoS Attack Protection</BR>
Includes the comparison of the traffic before and after protection. Click the legend to view only the traffic before or after protection. Move the mouse to the figure to show the traffic data of that line.

3. CC Defense Report</BR>
Anti-DDoS Pro defends CC attack and a CC defense report will be produced. CC report supports switching between different domains.</BR>
Because CC defense only takes effect on the Web Service, of all CC defense reports, only the Web Service forwarding rules can produce CC defense traffic.
