 ![Website Forwarding Rules](https://github.com/jdcloudcom/cn/blob/edit/image/Advanced%20Anti-DDoS/CC%20rules%2001.png)
The following is the interpretation of the rules:
- CC defense of the protection rules takes effect globally, so global CC defense is on when the CC defense is on.
- If the global CC defense is closed, all CC defense of the configured domain names in the website forwarding setting will be turned off.
- CC defense peak value shows the peak size of CC defense of the purchased package.
- CC defense mode configuration. The system supports four kinds of CC defense modes: </BR>
"Loose": Only few of the visits will be checked through CC rules. Suitable for websites with not many visits. </BR>
"Normal": When there is no obvious exception in the website, please select the normal mode. Only part of visits is checked</BR>
"Critical": In case of the slow website response, and exception in the CPU, memory, etc., use the emergency mode. This mode is of rigorous detection and may cause false judgment. </BR>
"Customization": Appropriate for advanced users. Enables them to customize the protection threshold. Includes HTTP request number threshold, the protection threshold of each Host, the protection threshold of each Host + URI, the protection threshold of each source IP to Host, the protection threshold of each source IP to Host + URI. The maximum HTTP request number threshold does not exceed the threshold of the purchased package. </BR>

3. Configure CC defense policies for single domain name. </BR>
 - If the global CC defense is on, the CC defense of a separate domain name can be closed.
 - If global CC defense is off, the CC defense of certain single domain name cannot be turned on.
4. CC Observation Mode</BR>
If CC observation mode is turned on, CC defense only sends alarm and does not activate protection.
5. Configure Speed Limit
- Advanced protection supports limiting the visit speed of source IP. Click the "Edit" button in the speed limit rule for settings. The minimum time can be set to seconds.
