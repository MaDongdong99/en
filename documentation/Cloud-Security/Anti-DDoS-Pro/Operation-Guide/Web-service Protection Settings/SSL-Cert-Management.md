### Certificate Management
 **Under the SSL Certificate Management** menu, the certificates in Anti-DDoS Pro can be managed in a centralized way. After the upload is complete, the certificate can be referenced in the web service configuration.

- A certificate that has been associated with a domain name displays the associated domain information.

### Certificate Reference

For a certificate that has been uploaded in SSL Certificate Management, find the domain name that needs to be associated in the web service forwarding settings, and directly the certificate. If you need to replace a certificate, click the edit icon next to the HTTPS button to change it. If there is no appropriate certificate, please upload one under the **SSL Certificate Management** menu.
