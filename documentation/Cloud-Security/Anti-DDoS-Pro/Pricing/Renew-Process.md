5. Notes:

- Anti-DDoS Pro Renewal page does not support setting unified expiration time.

- The duration supported by renewal is consistent with that supported by purchase:

That is, package below 100G supports monthly and annual renewal; while package above 100G supports only annual renewal rather than monthly renewal.
