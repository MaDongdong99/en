**Q: What will happen if the bound resource has been expired, Anti-DDoS Protection Package has not been expired?**

A: The protection package is bought monthly, if no protection object is configured, or the protection object has been expired, it cannot provide protection.

Suppose the user has bound IP of some virtual machine, if the virtual machine resource is expired and deleted, whether Anti-DDoS Protection Package bills normally or not, the protection for IP in the protection package will lose efficacy at once. Relevant configuration of this IP in the protection package will be deleted automatically.



**Q: The protection bandwidth of the original Anti-DDoS Basic is 2G, and I bought the package of Anti-DDoS Protection Package, then will the final protection peak value be superimposed?**

A: The final protection peak value of the protection package bought by you will not be superimposed, dominated by those in the package of Anti-DDoS Protection Package.

Eg: IP of some virtual machine originally has 2G free Anti-DDoS Basic, because it is often attacked, and the user bought 5G Anti-DDoS Protection Package for this IP. The maximum protection capability of this user is 5G, without superimposing the free quota of the original Anti-DDoS Basic.
