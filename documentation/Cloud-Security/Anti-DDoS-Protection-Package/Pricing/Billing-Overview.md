# Billing Overview

## Charging Items
Charging items of the JD Cloud anti-DDoS protection package include basic protection and elastic protection.

### Basic Protection
The permanent defense capability provided by anti-DDoS protection package is calculated by attack peak (Gbps) and charged based on monthly package.

Exclusive IP and shared IP supported by anti-DDoS protection package could be selected according to demands.

### Elastic Protection
Elastic protection refers to the provided expanded DDoS protection capability after the actual attack traffic is higher than the basic protection capability.
Configuration of elastic protection could be upgraded or downgraded. If the attack traffic fails to exceed the protection peak of basic protection, no fees are charged.



## Payment Method:
### Pay-In-Advance
Due to pay-in-advance, basic protection could be charged yearly/monthly. Upgrading is allowed only.
### Pay-As-You-Go
Elastic protection is charged daily. According to the attack peak which is actually happened in the former day and exceeds the basic DDoS protection capability (Gbps), the pay-as-you-go bill is produced. If the attack does not exceed the defense peak of basic protection, elastic protection is not charged.
