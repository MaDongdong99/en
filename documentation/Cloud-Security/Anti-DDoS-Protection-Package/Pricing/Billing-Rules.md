# Billing Rules

Anti-DDoS protection package supports two billing types:
 * Monthly Package Billing
 * Monthly Package + Pay-As-You-Go

## Monthly Package
### Introduction
If you only purchase the basic protection, you will be charged by the pay-in-advance method based on the monthly package;

You could choose exclusive IP and shared IP to improve protection capabilities of different numbers of IPs.

We provide the permanent protection capability only by the way of monthly package according to your selected package.



## Monthly Package + Pay-As-You-Go
### Introduction
If you purchase elastic protection, the cost of elastic protection will be charged based on monthly package.
Elastic protection is charged daily. The pay-as-you-go bill is produced according to the attack peak which is actually happened in the former day and exceeds the interval range of basic DDoS protection peak (Gbps).
If the attack does not exceed the defense peak of basic protection, elastic protection is not charged.
