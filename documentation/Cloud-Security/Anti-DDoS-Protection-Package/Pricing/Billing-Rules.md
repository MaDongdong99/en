You could choose exclusive IP and shared IP to improve protection capabilities of different numbers of IPs.

Monthly package what means we will only provide the protection capability as you subscribed.



## Monthly Package + Pay-As-You-Go
### Introduction
If you purchase elastic protection, the cost of elastic protection will be charged based on monthly package.
Elastic protection is charged daily. The pay-as-you-go bill is produced according to the attack peak which is actually happened in the former day and exceeds the interval range of basic DDoS protection peak (Gbps).
If the attack does not exceed the defense peak of basic protection, elastic protection is not charged.
