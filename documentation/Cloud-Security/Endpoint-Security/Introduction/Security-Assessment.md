# Free Security Evaluation 

### Introduction to Security Evaluation Plan

JD Cloud Endpoint Security products can be installed in a non-JD environment. As long as you have a JD Cloud account (even a JD Mall account), you can log in to evaluate security of your local server (e.g.: local IDC and other public clouds).
To enable users outside JD Cloud to better understand the Endpoint Security function, this promotion plan will provide users with an enterprise version security report without any charge. We recommend that, after installing the multi-cloud client, you run it for a week and then obtain the security evaluation report.
