1. Detection Capability: It's getting harder and harder to detect rootkits on the system. As the supplement to the antivirus software, the system back door detection capability can help users deeply detect whether the system file has been tampered, and whether there are known rootkit programs, hidden processes or hidden network communication.

2. Support the system back door detection and scanning of all Virtual Machines.
