# Billing Overview

## Charging Items

Billing items of JD Cloud Intelligent Edge Security include: business acceleration bandwidth (pay-in-advance + pay-as-you-go), security protection package (pay-in-advance) and DDoS elastic security protection (pay-as-you-go).

### Business Acceleration Bandwidth

The fixed acceleration bandwidth can be purchased for the business acceleration bandwidth and shall be charged by monthly package. The part exceeding the fixed acceleration bandwidth will adopt the pay-as-you-go method as per peak bandwidth.

### Security Protection Package

The price of security protection will vary with the specifications.

### DDoS Elastic Security Protection

DDoS elastic security protection refers to that when the actual attack traffic exceeds the basic protection capability, the expandable DDoS protection capability will be provided, including expansion of DDoS attack protection peak (Gbps) and CC protection peak (QPS). Configuration of elastic protection could be upgraded or downgraded. If the attack flow fails to exceed the protection peak of basic protection, no fees are charged.



## Payment Method

### Pay-In-Advance

It covers security protection and business acceleration bandwidth, shall be billed yearly/monthly in a unified way and can be upgraded rather than degraded.

### Pay-As-You-Go

The DDoS elastic protection part is charged daily according to the actual charge incurred the day before. For attack peak exceeding basic DDoS protection capability (Gbps) or CC defense capability (QPS), the major billing interval prevails, with a pay-as-you-go bill produced. If the attack does not exceed the defense peak of basic protection, elastic protection is not charged.

The part exceeding the business acceleration bandwidth purchased shall be charged by days as per the bandwidth peak, with bandwidth counted per 5 minutes and 288 points counted per day in total. For each billing, the maximum bandwidth (bandwidth peak) of the user in this billing period is billed as per the daily tier. If the attack does not exceed the basic business acceleration bandwidth, no charge will be made.
