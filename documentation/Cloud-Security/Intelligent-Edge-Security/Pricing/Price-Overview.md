## Business Acceleration Bandwidth

By default, 100Mbps will be given as a gift. You can purchase greater business acceleration bandwidth according to demands. The business acceleration bandwidth and security protection have the same purchase cycle. RMB 4,000 is charged for each additional 50Mbps and maximum 2,000Mbps can be purchased.

The part exceeding the business acceleration bandwidth purchased shall be charged as per the bandwidth peak: The consumed bandwidth peak shall be charged, with bandwidth counted per 5 minutes and 288 points counted per day in total. For each billing, the maximum bandwidth (bandwidth peak) of the user in this billing period is billed as per the daily tier.

| **Billing Mode** | **Billing Tier**      | **Price (RMB/Mbps/day)** |
| :----------- | :---------------- | :--------------------- |
| Bandwidth Peak     | 0-512Mbps (Inclusive)     | 1                      |
| Bandwidth Peak     | 512Mbps-5Gbps (Inclusive) | 0.9                    |
| Bandwidth Peak     | >5Gbps            | 0.75                   |
