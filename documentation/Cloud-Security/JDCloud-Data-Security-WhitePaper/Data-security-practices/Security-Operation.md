## 5. Security Operation Guarantee

With the security operation mechanism, the latest network security dynamics and security intelligence can be obtained in time, and relevant security incidents can be processed in first time, guaranteeing platform safety and stability as well as user data business security. Relying on security product service and security operation standards, the security operation team provides all-around security guarantee, including security monitoring, security warning, security response as well as security operation and maintenance.

- Security Monitoring

JD Cloud builds an automatic security monitoring system, with the monitoring range covering internal and external key service components, key upstream and downstream service components, etc. Make co-analysis to alarm information and log record to each security device, build corresponding models in combination with learning technology and expertise, and detect known and unknown data security threat and risk.

The utilization rates of core resources such as memory, disk and network interface for different service components are monitored, and a stricter exception threshold line is set. The operation team shall be informed in a timely manner to quickly solve the problems through the wrong statistics. New addition, deletion and addition of monitoring require clear processes. The monitoring level, target, monitoring receiver and exception disposal plan shall be defined for monitoring to ensure that the incident response plan in case of alarms can be performed immediately.

- Security Warning

JD Cloud builds a unified analysis and warning cloud security operation platform. Through unified collection, processing and analysis of JD Cloud’s security data of different dimensions, management persons can realize asset monitoring to the whole network, incident analysis and audit, risk assessment and measurement, warning and response, as well as location and disposal. Through standard process, continuous and real-time security operation work can be done.

JD Cloud builds an asset weakness monitoring system, realizes full-process track and management to association analysis and risk assessment to asset information, vulnerability discovery, vulnerability processing, vulnerability disclosure, combines invasion check and threat intelligence and analyzes network and assets in the cloud through Situation Awareness. Make sure vulnerabilities of each service product and component of cloud platform are timely discovered and fixed, reducing risks caused by maliciously using vulnerabilities.

- Security Response

During daily running of cloud platform and service, risks are actively controlled, and data and business recovery at different levels such as storage and application are achieved under an emergency, by use of the self-recovery ability of the security expert team as well as cloud platform and service.

The security operation team will rectify and advance the potential of the intrusion such as hidden dangers, vulnerabilities, risks and blind spots before the incident is discovered, so as to reduce the occurrence of security incidents. Once a security incident occurs, the security operation team will discover it quickly, analyze it, determine its level and make response immediately. After the security incident, it assesses its impact scope and harm degree, deeply analyzes its root cause, and carries out security recovery and retesting of the system with issue and potential hazard. JD Cloud has allocated a 7※24 security incident response expert team to execute the emergency plan and recovery process, notify security vulnerabilities, rectify risks, help users to rapidly solve security issues and reduce the influence on business.

- Security Operation and Maintenance

JD Cloud’s security team has built a strict and fine-grained permission management mechanism to assure the stable running of the cloud platform, and requires that the operation and maintenance personnel always adhere to the basic principle that "the operation related to user data requires obtaining the user’s authorization, the operation doing harm to user data is avoided". For the Virtual Machines migration, data relocation, key operation and maintenance for business expansion directly related to user data security, JD Cloud has developed a specific operating specification in which some standard requirements are specified for the operation and maintenance personnel.

To guarantee the security and reliability of user data, JD Cloud has developed the operation and maintenance platform and tool to make operation and maintenance automatic and process-based and reduce manual intervention. For example, all the operation and maintenance accounts of the production environment are managed in a unified way by use of bastion hosts, and the login access is operated and maintained, so that all the operation and maintenance operations can be carried out only with bastion hosts. The unified log audit system safely stores all the background operation and maintenance operation records of the operation management team, and the internal audit team regularly further reviews the operation and maintenance operation records.
