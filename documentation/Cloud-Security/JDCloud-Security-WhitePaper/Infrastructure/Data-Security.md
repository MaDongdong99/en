# 4. Data Security

JD Cloud is subject to the advanced industry standards for data security life cycle management, and adopts means in both management and technology aspects to conduct the construction of comprehensive data security system. In the aspects of identity verification, permission management, IAM, data encryption, data isolation, transmission security, storage security, data destruction and so on, the user's rights of privacy, ownership and control to the data are protected from infringement, and the user is provided with the most effective data protection.

· Identity Verification and IAM

A user identity management and resource access control service (IAM) provided by JD Cloud. Users can create and manage sub-user accounts through the IAM service, and control the access right of these sub-users to JD Cloud resources. See details in "IAM" chapter.

· Static Data Protection

The user is responsible for guaranteeing that the data stored in the cloud platform are encrypted according to standards. Cloud platform provide various encryption functions so that the user may select the best solution meeting their demands. It helps the user maintain the control on key pair, so that the cloud applications and services are used to encrypt data; it also uses the cloud disk encryption to encrypt the virtual machine, and the storage service encryption may encrypt all the data in the user’s storage account. It also provides various data storage solutions to meet different demands, including file, disk and list storage etc.

· Data Isolation

Isolation of cloud data is implemented through Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and the VPC space is completely controlled by the user. It deeply isolates the networks of different tenants, and protects the data of different tenants from being obtained without authorization. See details in "VPC" chapter.

· Data Protection in Transmission

The communications on cloud product console are protected through encryption by HTTPS security protocol. The industrial standard Transport Layer Security SSL/TLS is used to encrypt the internal communication among the user and the cloud, cloud platform system as well as data center, in order to protect the data transmitted to and from any component and also the data transmitted internally.

· Data Redundancy

In case of network attack or physical damage to the data center, the data are guaranteed to be under protection. Data may be replicated in the selected geographic region to implement redundancy, without being transmitted beyond the region. The user may use multiple options to replicate data, including specifying the number of copies, and replicating the number and location of the data center.

· Data Destruction

When the user files a request or the contract is terminated, JD Cloud will delete all the data. When the user deletes the data or leaves JD Cloud, all the retired magnetic storage devices will be demagnetized or physically destroyed according to industrial standard practices. When a certain storage device has reached the end of its service life, the retirement process included in JD Cloud program may prevent user data from being exposed to any unauthorized person.
