# 2. Physical and Environmental Security
## 2.1 Physical Security of Machine Room

JD Cloud develops perfect physical and environmental security protection policies, procedures and measures, meeting the Class A standards in GB 50174 Code for Design of Electronic Information System Room and the T3+ standards in TIA 942 Telecommunications Infrastructure Standard for Data Centers. They also include the following physical and environmental security control requirements in this chapter. JD Cloud contains multilevel security protection measures in the data center, and the operation and maintenance team strictly implements IAM, security protection measures, routine monitoring and audit, emergency response and other measures to ensure the physical and environmental security of JD Cloud Data Center.

· Machine Room Site Selection

The site selection, construction or lease of data centers of JD Cloud throughout the world are in accordance with the relevant international standards and local security requirements.

· Power Protection

The power system of the data center is fully redundant and maintainable, to guarantee the 7\*24h continuous running of JD Cloud business; the power supply is the multi-substation double-circuit mains supply; after the interruption of mains supply, diesel generator and UPS can normally take over the power supply, and manostat as well as overvoltage protection devices are configured on the machine room power supply circuits.

· Control of Temperature and Humidity

Through the automatic adjustment of precise air conditioner and intensive humidifier, the temperature and humidity of the data center are maintained within the range allowed for the running of devices, to keep the server and device components in good running status.

· Anti-static

Anti-static floor is installed in the data center, and cabinets and trunking are equipped with earth wires, so as to prevent the damage from static electricity to electrical devices.

· Fire Control Capability

The data center is equipped with automatic fire detection and suppression device to reduce risks. The fire detection system utilizes all the smoke detection sensors, machine and electrical infrastructure spaces, refrigerating chambers and power generation device room in the data center. These regions are protected by a wet, dual interlocking pre-action or gas sprinkler system.

· Monitoring Management

The data center is equipped with the CCTV system, the access control system as well as the environment and device centralized monitoring system, to monitor the temperature and humidity in the cold channel, on-off status of the power distribution cabinet, cabinet current, UPS running status, running status of chilled water air conditioning system as well as water and oil leakage monitoring alarm system. Daily maintenance protection system machine room patrol requirements shall be strictly complied with so that hidden security dangers will be found and repaired in time.

## 2.2 Personnel Access Management

JD Cloud develops a perfect Machine Room Access Management System from systems and policies to process management, and builds a comprehensive security management system in cooperation with strict supervision and audit, to guarantee the physical and environmental security of the cloud computing data center through continuous improvement.

Strict systems are developed for data centers of JD Cloud according the regional security requirements of different levels, including the access control system, personnel vehicle permission and checkpoints, equipped with 7\*24h no blind spot video monitoring alarm system as well as security personnel.

Based on the data center personnel types and access permission, a complete personnel IAM security matrix is built. It clearly provides the company personnel access approval management, third-party personnel aces approval management and data center machine room access requirements, to implement the effective management and control of the access, operation and other actions of each type of personnel in the data center. Based on the posts and roles of access employees, employees are given limited resource access permission and subject to the minimum permission and responsibility separation principles.

All the external personnel (visitors, suppliers’ technicians, test personnel, substitute maintaining personnel, etc.) must only be able to enter the machine room upon the confirmation of the machine room manager when they operate in data center machine room and other restricted regions, and make machine room access registration. The internal employees shall accompany them and be responsible for the guardianship during the whole course.
