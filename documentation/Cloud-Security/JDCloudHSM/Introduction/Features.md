## The standard financial industry customized encryption and decryption needs of the People's Bank of China are met

#### Support application of financial and industrial IC cards (chip cards)
Support the relevant standards of the People's Bank of China (PBOC 1.0/2.0/3.0), support GP, TSM, EMV, etc.; support value-added business such as NFC.

#### Support application of traditional financial transactions (magnetic stripe cards)
Support PIN encryption, encryption conversion, verification and other operations; support CVV/CVN products and verification; support MAC calculation; support data signature and verification.

#### Support dynamic passwords
Support generation of seed keys and their secure transfer; support dynamic password calculation.

#### Graded Permission Management Function
Based on the graded permission management function of intelligent Ukey, the user password and device security are improved.

## Permission-Responsibility Separation

#### Device and Key Management
The cipher machine management is separated from the sensitive information management permission, so even the operation and maintenance personnel of JD Cloud cannot access the user's personal key

#### Control over Authorization for Sensitive Instructions
Sensitive instructions support classified authorization control, effectively preventing emergence of unauthorized acts

#### Support various verification methods
Support user name password verification, digital certificate verification and other permission verification methods

## Availability Guarantee
#### High Availability
Clustering and functions of Load Balancer between cipher machines are achieved to effectively respond to emergencies such as Data Center disconnection and device failure

#### Key Backup and Recovery
Support the key backup and recovery functions based on main key protection to ensure the security and reliability of the user application system.

#### Chip Array
Inside the cipher machine, the architecture design is achieved with a hardware chip array, and its use isn’t affected even if some hardware chips are damaged.

#### Exception Recovery System
The unique exception recovery system helps customers effectively cope with various emergencies
