- The JD Cloud HSM instance needs to be used together with JD Cloud VPC. Before the JD Cloud HSM instance is purchased, it is required to well configure the VPC network and subnet at the Console for its normal use.
- For security reasons, the JD Cloud HSM instance does not provide the public network access function. You need to use VPN to connect the management device to the VPC to manage the JD Cloud HSM instance.
- Currently, the JD Cloud HSM instance of cn-north-1/Availability Zone C is provided, and JD Cloud HSM will be released in other regions and availability zones.
