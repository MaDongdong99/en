## Features

### User’s Key Encryption Escrow

​	KMS provides centralized control over encrypted keys. You can use JD Cloud Console, OpenAPI and other tools to easily create, manage and alternate your Key.

### Confidential Data Encryption Escrow

​	KMS also provides an escrow service for confidential data (Secrets), and you can secure sensitive information by hosting it in KMS.

### Log Audit

​	Information about each use of the Key you store in KMS will be recorded in the logging system, including details of the user, time, date, and Key used.

### Security and Reliability

​	KMS is designed for that no one can retrieve your plain text Key from the service, which uses the hardware security module (HSM) to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your Key, and that your plain text key will not be stored in any form in any storage and the key will not be transmitted outside the KMS service area.

### High Availability and Disaster Recovery Backup

​	KMS uses real-time remote backups and offline remote backup to ensure the security and integrity of the Key, and uses distributed system to ensure the high availability of the service.
