## ** Local Verification**

  Before switching the service traffic to WAF, we recommend that you ensure all configurations and WAF forwarding to be normally by local verification first. Local verification needs to simulate WAF access at local, then access the protected website to verify the normal forwarding of WAF.

  By modifying local hosts file to simulate WAF access, which guides the requests accessing the protected websites from local to WAF.

Letâ€™s take Windows operating system as an example to introduce the steps of local verification in detail:

1. Use notepad, notepad++ or other text editor to open the hosts file that is generally located in the path of C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts.

Specific Methods:

Click Start button, click Running, enter C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts in the popped dialogue box. Click OK and Select to Open it with Notepad

2. Append the following contents at the last line: the domain name protected by the IP of WAF.

 3. Save the hosts file, perform ping to the protected domain name. 

Click start and run cmd, enter Ping and the domain name written just now.

 4. View the results. If it displays the IP Address associated just now (WAF IP Address), it means that the verification is successful.

If it displays the original IP address (origin server IP address), please flush the local DNS cache (enter ipconfig/flushdns command under cmd).

5. Verify whether the forwarding is normal. After confirming the host association has taken effect (the domain name has been resolved as WAF IP by local), open the browser and enter this domain name to access.

The configuration of WAF is correct and the website can be browsed normally.
