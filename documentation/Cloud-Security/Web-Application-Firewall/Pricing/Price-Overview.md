#### Exclusive Protection IP

The Web Application Firewall (Cloud WAF) supports the purchase of exclusive IP and assigns a separate protection IP to each domain under the Cloud WAF Instance. By default, all domains protected by the Cloud WAF Instance use the same protection IP. Purchasing exclusive protection IP helps to better protect domain stability and prevent DDoS attacks on one domain leading to that the entire cloud WAF instance IP enters the black hole and all domains under this instance to be inaccessible.

| ------ | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Exclusive IP | RMB 160/Each | RMB 160/Each | RMB 160/Each | RMB 160/Each |
