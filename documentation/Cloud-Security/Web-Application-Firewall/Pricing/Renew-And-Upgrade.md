# Renewal and Upgrade

To prevent the expiration of the Web Application Fire instance you have purchased from impacting your business, you can renew the instance before it expires. If the Web Application Fire instance you currently have cannot meet your business demand, you can upgrade it from a lower version to a higher version, or you can increase the number of domain expansion packs and bandwidth expansion packs as needed.


## Renewal Description

If you have purchased a Web Application Firewall instance, you can renew it before the instance expires to extend its service duration.

7 days before the service expires, the system will inform you that the service is about to expire via SMS or email and remind you to renew it. After the service expires, the protection service will be stopped, and the configuration of the Web Application Firewall instance will be kept for you for 7 days. If the service is renewed within 7 days, the protection can continue. If you do not renew the service within these 7 days, your Web Application Firewall instance will be released and the protection for your website will be invalid.
