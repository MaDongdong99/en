- **Application Scenarios of Cloud VPC Intranet Scan**

  With the migration and JD Cloud Onboarding of an enterprise’s own businesses, the cloud network topology is generally divided into business access, Internet access and management access. Various application systems in the cloud are encapsulated in the VLAN of VPC. Currently, most public vulnerability scan solutions are exposed to public network IP or domain via Internet scan. The cloud network architecture is beyond the control of most enterprises.

  Considering this, JD Cloud & AI's Website Threat Inspector launched the scenario of supporting threat scan for assets of cloud VPC intranet. Further, the overall security situation in cloud can be assessed with the product in combination with Situation Awareness. In this way, the product can discover the intranet asset vulnerability ahead of the hacker, reduce attack surfaces of intranet and decrease lateral attack penetration risk of cloud intranet.

- **Application Scenarios of External IDC Asset Scan**

  In the process that an enterprise gradually migrates its businesses to JD Cloud, some of its businesses have been migrated to JD Cloud, while some are still kept in the local data center or hosted in the IDC Data Center for a long period. However, this undoubtedly increases great work load about asset vulnerability risk management, operation and maintenance to operation and maintenance personnel of such enterprise.

  Considering this, JD Cloud & AI's Website Threat Inspector launched the scenario of threat scan supported by assets of a user’s IDC Data Center. Only after the rapid deployment probe is rapidly downloaded and manual deployment is made in the external IDC link, you can intensively manage vulnerability risk statuses of externally distributed IDC assets with the Website Threat Inspector of JD Cloud & AI.
