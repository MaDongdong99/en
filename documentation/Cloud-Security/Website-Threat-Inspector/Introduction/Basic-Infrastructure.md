## Loose Coupling Design Concept

![](../../../../image/Website-Threat-Inspector/wts-jiagou-04.png)

Website Threat Inspector is designed under the concept of loose coupling and is mainly divided into three modules, i.e., API, scheduling and execution; Redis and MySQL are used as ways of data storage. The components have the following functions:

| Module             | Function                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| API Module          | API is used to connect to services and all requests for configuring product and getting category are carried out through APIs.  |
| Scheduling Module         | Scheduling is the "core" module of the product and used to execute works such as unit information collection, status monitoring, task acquisition and task assignment |
| Execution Module       | Execution is mainly designed to execute tasks assigned by the scheduling module and store them in the database through APIs. |
| Redis   Storage Module | Redis mainly stores some temporary information during running, for instance, when a task is running, the statuses and results of the tasks required to be read and written frequently are stored in Redis. After a task is over, the data content in Redis will be synchronized to MySQL |
| MySQL Storage Module    | MySQL stores all scan tasks and the scan result information                           |
| Component Upgrade         | POC plug-in and execution component support hot update and upgrade, with the upgrade file stored in the file center. |

## Module Execution in Steps

The execution module of Website Threat Inspector is executed in steps:

- Each of the steps can be used independently and scanned, and loose coupling happens between the steps.
- It is also supported that some execution components rely on the result of the preceding execution components.
- For example, scanning vulnerabilities in ports can rely on the results of port scan and port fingerprints, which can enhance the scan accuracy and speed.

## Distributed Architecture Design

Website Threat Inspector is provided with a distributed architecture, which coincides with the characteristics of **consistency**, **availability** and **partition tolerance** and can provide high-quality and highly stable scan service.

- The task assignment and task execution operate in separated modules. A task status monitoring mechanism is predesigned to ensure any wrong tasks will be re-assigned to guarantee business continuity.

- There is a monitoring mechanism for working resources of execution module. If the machine status of execution module is unavailable, the scheduling will exclude this machine from the availability list, and wonâ€™t assign tasks to it any more.

-  The product adopts multi-regional, active-active and multi-active deployment to effectively ensure service continuity, which means when a machine in a region breaks down, the product can still provide services normally.

-  If no scan tasks are running currently or the running scan tasks are few, the execution module will be in the sleep mode. This will reduce invalid resource consumption. When a new task is assigned, the execution module will be intelligently awakened to execute a scan task in accordance with the task conditions.
- Below is the working time sequence diagram of the product, setting out the simple working process of the execution module
