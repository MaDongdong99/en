# Benefits

## All-round Coverage of Vulnerability Risks

- **High Vulnerability Detection Accuracy**

  The web2.0 intelligent crawling technology is adopted to optimize internal verification mechanism and reduce interference caused by vulnerabilities to customers to the maximum extent.

- **Full Coverage of All Vulnerability Types**

  Cover various vulnerability monitoring types such as OWASP Top10 vulnerability detection and PoC plug-in detection.

## Multi-scenario Coverage of Asset Types

- **Provision of Internet Service IP/Domain Asset**

  Add any of your IP/domain assets in the public network, and help assess the risk of your assets in the public network.

- **Cloud User VPC Intranet Asset**

  Immediately find the vulnerability risk in the Virtual Machines assets run in JD Cloud & AI's internal system by deploying JD Cloud & AI's intranet threat scan probe.

- **User IDC Data Center Intranet Asset**

  Immediately find an asset run in IDC Data Center and its vulnerability risk by manually deploying an intranet threat scan probe in your IDC Data Center.

## Stereoscopic Scan of Risk Management

- **Visualized Risk Evaluation Report**

  A concise and visualized scan report provides you with analysis on asset security from many perspectives.

- **Man-machine Interaction and Simple and Easy to Use**

  Help with sort management of asset security and visualize the asset risk profile to make simpler operation and maintenance.

- **Stable and Reliable Elastic Expansion**

  The cluster elastic expansion architecture is used to quickly expand the scan engine cluster as required and realize elastic expansion of scan performance.

  Based on the cloud native distributed scan architecture, the modules in the system can be decoupled as far as possible by full use of the technical benefits of the cloud platform, reducing the degree of dependence between them, and making the whole system highly stable and expandable.
