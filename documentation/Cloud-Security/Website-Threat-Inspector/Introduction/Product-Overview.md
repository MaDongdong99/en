# Website Threat Scan System 

Integrating four core functions, i.e. automatic asset association discovery, Web vulnerability scan, port vulnerability scan and weak password detection, it can discover the network security risk of websites or servers, provide multi-dimensional security detection service to cloud business, meet compliance requirements and detect every website security vulnerability.

## Benefits

In-depth vulnerability scan: Support: OWASP Top10 vulnerability detection types, PoC plug-in detection and asset fingerprint scan correlation capacity  

Detailed report: Provide detailed vulnerability scan reports, covering: Existing Web security vulnerability in system, application system security vulnerability, existing weak password of system, etc., and their fix recommendations, and guide and help users to fix up vulnerabilities  

Efficient and accurate: The web2.0 intelligent crawling technology is adopted and the internal verification mechanism is being continuously optimized for increasing detection accuracy  

Distributed scan architecture: Based on the cloud original distributed scan architecture, the modules in the system can be decoupled as far as possible by full use of the technical benefits of the cloud platform, reducing the degree of dependence between them, and making the whole system highly stable and expandable.
