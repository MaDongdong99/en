### Add scan assets

[Scenario 1]: The scanner automatically import the information about the domain/sub-domain registered under JD Cloud domain name resolution service, requiring no verification. At the same time, adding asset cookies is supported (after an asset is added, click **Manage** to add cookies information).

[Scenario 2]: The scanner automatically import the address of public IP registered under this PIN, requiring no verification. At the same time, adding asset cookies is supported (after an asset is added, click **Manage** to add cookies information).

[Scenario 3]: The user needs to manually add the information about the domain/sub-domain registered under JD Cloud domain name resolution service (it is verified by CNAME in case of main domain added, or by files in case of sub-domain added), requiring verification. At the same time, adding asset cookies is supported (after an asset is added, click **Manage** to add cookies information).

### Verification Management

First, add the relevant verification information based on the verification scenario, and then manually click **Verify**.

[Domain verification scenario], click **Verify** to generate cname information, with one cname record generated by each of the PINs, and the user needs to log in to his own domain name resolution service to add the relevant generated cname information.

[IP/Subdomain verification scenario], click **Verify** to generate the asset verification file. One PIN generates one verification file, and the user needs to log in to his own website to add it to the root directory of the website.
