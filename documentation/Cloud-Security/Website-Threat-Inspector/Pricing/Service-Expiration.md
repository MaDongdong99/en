## Extra Use and Quota Run-out

- **Pay By Once Extra Use Description:**

  In Pay By Once, because the scan quota usage of a user is reported in certain cycle, if the user exceeds the purchased quota when using the scan task, an arrearage bill will be generated in line with the extra use times and the scan task will be stopped within certain cycle after the scan service is finished and then returned to the view status of the basic version (a status where you can only view the historical scan results but cannot assign a new scan task).

- **Result of Service Quota Run-out:**

  For basic version (including 5 free scans), pay by quantity version and monthly package (enterprise version), when the quota of the service version is run out, the product will return to the view status of the basic version (a status where you can only view the historical scan results but cannot assign a new scan task).
