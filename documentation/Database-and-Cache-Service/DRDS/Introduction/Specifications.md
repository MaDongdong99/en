# Instance Types Supported by DRDS
Since DRDS does not store data by itself and the data are stored on RDSÂ·MySQL, so only this specification has differences of CPU and memory size only.

It provides the following instance types and it will provide more rich types as required by users later.

|Number of CPU Cores|Memory (GB)|Number of Nodes|
|-|-|-|
|4|16|2|
|8|32|2|
|16|64|2|
