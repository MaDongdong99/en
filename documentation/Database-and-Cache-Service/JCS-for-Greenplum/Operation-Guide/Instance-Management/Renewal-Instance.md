# Renewal Instance

With the JD Cloud Console, you can renew the currently running instance. Please renew the payment within 7 days after expiration of the instance or arrearage, otherwise the instance will be deleted.

## Note

As for the instance subject to pay-by-configuration billing, after the renewal is completed, the instance billing type will change to monthly package.

1. Log in the [Greenplum Console](https://jdw-console.jdcloud.com/list).

2. On the Instance List page, select the instance of which the payment is to be renewed, and click **Renew ** in the operation item on the right.
