# Restart Instance

If your JDW instance runs abnormally but does not confirm the cause, you might consider rebooting the instance.

## Note

- Rebooting an instance can cause the connection to be interrupted. Please do make sure that you have well made the business arrangement before the operation.

## Operation Steps

1. Log in the [JDW Console](https://jdw-console.jdcloud.com/list).

2. On the Instance List page, select the instance you want to reboot and click **Reboot** in the operation item on the right.

4. The instance status changes to "Rebooting". Wait for the reboot to complete.

5. After the reboot is complete, the instance status will change to "running".
