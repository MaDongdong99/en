# Restart Instance

If your Greenplum instance runs abnormally but does not confirm the cause, you might consider rebooting the instance.

## Note

- Rebooting an instance can cause the connection to be interrupted. Please do make sure that you have well made the business arrangement before the operation.

## Operation Steps

1. Log in the [Greenplum Console](https://jdw-console.jdcloud.com/list).

2. On the Instance List page, select the instance you want to reboot and click **Reboot** in the operation item on the right.

3. Click **OK** in the confirmation popup.

4. The instance status changes to "Rebooting". Wait for the reboot to complete.

5. After the reboot is complete, the instance status will change to "running".
