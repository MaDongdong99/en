# Delete instance

If you no longer need to use any InfluxDB instance, you can delete it.

## Note

- The billing type is a pay-by-configuration type instance and you can delete it at any time.
- The billing type is a monthly package type instance, and the unexpired deletion is not supported for the time being.
- After the instance is deleted, it cannot be restored. Please be cautious.

## Operation Steps
