# Product Benefits

## Easy to Use

With the JD Cloud console or simple API calls, you can create MongoDB instances in minutes, quickly investing in business applications and reducing business wait times.

## High Service Availability

By default, a highly available architecture with a three-node replica set is provided, which supports automatic disaster tolerance switching to ensure business availability. In addition, you can choose the instance deployment mode as a single availability zone deployment or a multiple availability zone deployment to provide different disaster tolerance levels.

## Data lasting

It has a complete data backup mechanism, supporting automatic backup and manual backup. Each instance is automatically backed up once every day by default. You can also create backups at any time according to business conditions. The backup files are saved in the form of three copies in JD Cloud Object Storage Service. Don't worry about data loss.

## Safety

The instance is deployed in the user-defined VPC by default. Network isolation protection is performed directly at the TCP layer to ensure data security. At the same time, you can limit the IP of the connectable instance through the white list function, and accurately control the security from the access source.

## Scalable

Supports flexible capacity expansion and capacity reduction. You can adjust the instance configuration as needed according to the business situation, improve resource utilization and reduce the cost of use. The configuration changes process does not affect service operations.

## Easy to operate and maintain
The console provides a wealth of visual monitoring data indicators, and the data is clear at a glance. You can also set up automatic alarm rules to keep track of the running of your instances anytime, anywhere.
