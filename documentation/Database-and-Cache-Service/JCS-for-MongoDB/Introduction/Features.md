### Multiple Availability Zone Deployment

Support for multiple availability zone deployment, you can specify the available zones for primary, secondary and hidden node deployments, and provide high availability across the machine rooms.

## Security

### VPC Virtual Private Cloud

The instance is deployed in a user-defined VPC, and network isolation protection is performed directly at the TCP layer to ensure data security.

### White List
