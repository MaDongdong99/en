# Set Automatic Backup

The JCS for MongoDB supports automatic backup. After the instance is created, a full backup is performed every day. The backup data is stored in the JD Cloud Object Storage Service, and can be kept for up to 7 days. Currently, no fee is charged. The default start time of the backup task is 0:00-1:00 every day. You can adjust the automatic backup time according to the business situation.


## Precautions
- Deletion of automatic backup files is not supported.
- If automatic backup has been performed that day and the time to modify the automatic backup is post to the current time, the backup will still be created.

## Operation Steps
1. Login [MongoDB Console](https://mongodb-console.jdcloud.com/mongodb).
1. On the "Instance List" page, select the target instance, then click **Instance Name** to enter the "Instance Details" page.
