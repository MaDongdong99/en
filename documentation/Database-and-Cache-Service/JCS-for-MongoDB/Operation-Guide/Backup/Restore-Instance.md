# Data Recovery


The JCS for MongoDB supports one-click recovery of backup data to the original instance, and also the data recovery to minimize data loss.

## Precautions

- Data recovery will overwrite the original data with backup data. This operation is irreversible, please be cautious. It is recommended to manually create a backup before the operation.
- Do not write to the MongoDB instance during the data recovery process.
- The data recovery time is related to the quantity of data. When the amount of data is large, it takes a long time. Please wait patiently.

## Precondition

- The instance status is Running and the billing status is normal.

## Operation Steps

1. Login [MongoDB Console](https://mongodb-console.jdcloud.com/mongodb).
1. On the "Instance List" page, select the target instance, then click **Instance Name** to enter the "Instance Details" page.
1. On the Instance Details page, click **Backup and Recovery** to view the backup data.
