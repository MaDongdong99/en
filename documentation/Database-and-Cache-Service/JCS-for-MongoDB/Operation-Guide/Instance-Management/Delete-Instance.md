# Delete Instance

If you no longer need to use a MongoDB instance, you can delete it.

## Precautions
- The billing type is an instance pay by configuration and you can delete it at any time.
- The billing type is an instance under monthly package, and the unexpired deletion is not supported at this time.
- After the instance is deleted, it cannot be recovered. Please be cautious.
- After the instance is deleted, the backup data of the instance will be deleted and cannot be recovered. If you need to save backup data, please download the backup data in advance and save it locally. For downloading methods, please refer to: [Download Backup]().
