# Review Instance

Via JD Cloud Console, you can renew the currently running instance. Please renew the payment within 7 days after the instance expires or owed, otherwise the instance will be deleted.

## Precautions

- For the instance with billing type pay by configuration, after the renewal is completed, the instance billing type will be changed to monthly package.

## Operation Steps

1. Login [MongoDB Console](https://mongodb-console.jdcloud.com/mongodb).
1. Enter the "Instance List" page, select the target instance, and click **Renew** in the operation items to open the "Renewal" page.
