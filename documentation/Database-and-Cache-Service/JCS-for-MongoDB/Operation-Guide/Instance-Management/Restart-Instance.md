# Reboot Instance

If your MongoDB instance is running abnormally but cannot confirm the cause, you may consider rebooting the instance.

## Precautions

- Reboot will cause the connection to be interrupted. Please make sure that you have made the business arrangement before proceeding.
- Reboot may result in a master-slave switch, so be sure to connect the MongoDB instance by using the Connection String URI.

## Precondition

- The instance status is Running and the billing status is normal.

## Operation Steps
1.  Login [MongoDB Console](http://mongodb-console.jdcloud.com/mongodb)ã€‚
1. On the "Instance List" page, select the target instance, click **Reboot** in the operation items to open the configuration popup.
