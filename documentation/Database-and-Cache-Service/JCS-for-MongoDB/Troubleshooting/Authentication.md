## Problem Processing

It is required to enter the authentication library corresponding to the account when logging in MongoDB database, and if the authentication library is not correctly entered, it will prompt the failure of authentication. Assuming that the authorization library of your account is test, you can log in by using the following command:

> mongo --host xxxx.jdcloud.com:27017 --authenticationDatabase test -u <username> -p <password>

or

> mongodb://<username>:<password>@xxxx1.jdcloud.com:27017,xxxx2.jdcloud.com:27017/test?replicaSet=mgset-3937681456
