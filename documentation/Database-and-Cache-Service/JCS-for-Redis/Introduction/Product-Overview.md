JCS for Redis is a Key-Value type online cache service based on the open source JCS for Redis protocol, which supports the standard JCS for Redis protocol (based on revision 2.8.19). The "memory+hard disk" storage method can provide high-speed data reading and writing capabilities while meeting data persistence. At present, we provide a variety of specifications for the Primary-secondary version and the cluster version for users which can meet the requirements of availability, reliability and good performance in various business scenarios. It supports hot standby and provides automatic disaster tolerance switching and instance monitoring services to reduce business risks and ensure business continuity. Users can focus on business concerning their own products.
