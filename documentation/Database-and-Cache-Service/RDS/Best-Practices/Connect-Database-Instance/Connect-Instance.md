# Connection Instance
You can connect the instance through the JD Cloud DMS function and the local client can access the remote connection instance of the domain name through the internet if you purchased the instance of JCS for MySQL/Percona services. However, please provide right access control when the remote connection instance of the domain name is accessed via the internet, to ensure the database security.

## Connection Instances via Local Database Management Software

See the specific operation of manual open in [Open Internet Access](../../Operation-Guide/Instance/Internet-Access.md).
There are ways to access JCS for MySQL/Percona/MariaDB services, taking Sequel Pro software as an example.
