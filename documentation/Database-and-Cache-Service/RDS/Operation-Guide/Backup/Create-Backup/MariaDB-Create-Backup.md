# Create backup for JCS for MariaDB
JCS for MariaDB instance supports automatic backup and manual backup; you may set the triggering time point for automatic backup by modifying backup policy. For specific operations, see [Backup Policy](../Backup-Policy/MariaDB-Backup-Policy.md).
The backup of instance will be stored on cloud storage server of JD Cloud. At present, JD Cloud does not charge the space occupancy fee generated by backup.

## Precautions

* During implementing manual backup or automatic backup, implementing DDL modification will cause the failure of creating backup.
