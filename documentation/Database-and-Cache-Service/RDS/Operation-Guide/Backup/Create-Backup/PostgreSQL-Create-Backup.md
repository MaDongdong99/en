# PostgreSQL Create Backup
Cloud Database PostgreSQL instance supports automatic backup and manual backup; you may view the trigger time point for automatic backup via backup policy. For specific operations, see [Backup Policy](../Backup-Policy/PostgreSQL-Backup-Policy.md).
The backup of instance will be stored on cloud storage server of JD Cloud. At present, JD Cloud does not charge the space occupancy fee generated by backup.

## Note

* During implementing manual backup or automatic backup, implementing DDL modification will cause the failure of creating backup.
