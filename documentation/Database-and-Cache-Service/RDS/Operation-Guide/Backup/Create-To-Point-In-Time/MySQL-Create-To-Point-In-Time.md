# MySQL creates instances based on time points
In the process of using a cloud database instance, if the data in the cloud database instance contain dirty data due to a software exception or some unexpected situation, and then you want to restore to the data of a certain previous moment, you can use instance creation based on time points to recover a new cloud database instance.

## Preconditions
* The Cloud Database RDS permission has been enabled.
* Please ensure that your account balance (or coupon amount) is not less than RMB 50, if the created billing method is pay-by-configuration resource.
* The minimum time point selected for recovery is 30 minutes after the target instance creation time.

## Note 
* The specification of new instances cannot be smaller than that of the instance of the source of backup

## Operation Steps
1. Login [Cloud Database RDS Console](https://rds-console.jdcloud.com/database).
2. On the Instance List page, select the target instance for which a new instance is required to be created based on time points. Go to the Target Instance Details page and click *** Operate  -》Create according to Time Points*** in the upper right corner of the page to enter the creation page.
3. Parameters configured by instance are described as below:

* Region: Cannot be modified. It is the region of the backup source instance by default.
* Select date: You can select any day of the last 7 days, but it cannot be earlier than the creation date of the target instance, and the specific day is subject to the Console.
* Select time: If the date and the creation time of the target instance are the same, you can only select the moment 30 minutes after the creation time, and the specific time is subject to the Console.
* Database type: The database type of the created instance. The type cannot be modified here. By default, the database type of the target instance is used.
* Version: The database version of the created instance. The version cannot be modified. By default, the database version of the target instance is used.
* Storage type: The maximum IOPSs of the instance types corresponding to different storage classes are different. Please refer to the [MySQL Specifications](../../../Introduction/Specifications/MySQL-Specifications.md).
* Specification: Different specifications correspond to different maximum connection counts and maximum IOPSs for the CPU and memory of instances, please refer to [MySQL Specifications](../../../Introduction/Specifications/MySQL-Specifications.md) for the detailed descriptions about specifications.
* Bucket: The bucket includes the data space, system file space and log file space.
* VPC: Only creation in VPC is supported. If the user has no VPC and subnets, he can create VPC and subnets through the links of [Create VPC] and [Create Subnets]. After creation completion, click ** Refresh** to view the created VPC and subnets.
   * When selecting VPC, please ensure that the Virtual Machines required to be connected to a database instance is in the same VPC with the database instance.
   * Due to management needs, instance creation is allowed only when several remaining IPs are retained in the selected subnet.
      - MySQL, Percona, MariaDB: More than 4 remaining IPs are needed
* Deployment mode: Currently, two deployment methods, i.e., single availability zone deployment and multiple availability zone deployment are supported.
   * Multiple availability zone deployment: The master and slave databases are located in different availability zones respectively, and the availability is higher: When one availability zone fails, the entire instance can still provide services.
   * Single availability zone deployment: The master and slave databases are located in the same availability zone. If the availability zone fails, the entire instance cannot provide external services.
* Basic Information
   * Instance name: Duplication is allowed but the length and characters of the name have some limits which are subject to the Console.
* Parameter set: Only the parameter set with the database type can be selected. If there is no parameter set under the current account, the system will automatically create a default parameter set by default. 
* Purchase duration: It is required to select the purchase duration if the billing method is monthly package, and 1 month to 3 years can be selected; the longer duration you purchase, the more discounts you will enjoy, which is subject to the Console.
