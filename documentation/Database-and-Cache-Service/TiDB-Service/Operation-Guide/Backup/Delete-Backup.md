# Delete Backup
At present, each TiDB instance is allowed to have 3 manual backups. So, when you need to create a new manual backup, but the quota is unavailable now, you can select to delete the former manual backup.

> **Note: Only manual backup is allowed to be deleted**

## Operation Steps
1. Click a target instance, enter the Instance Details, switch to the [Backup Management] Page, find the database to be deleted and click **Delete**.
2. On the confirmation pop-up box, click **OK** to delete the backup.
