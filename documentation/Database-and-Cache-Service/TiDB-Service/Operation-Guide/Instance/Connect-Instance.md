# Connect Instance 
Can be connected through a MySQL connector or using an API connection if you bought the instance of TiDB Service. The database connector provides the client with a way to connect to the database server while APIs provide the underlying interfaces that use the MySQL protocol and resources. Both connectors and APIs can be used to connect to servers and execute sql statements in different languages and environments, including odbc, java(jdbc), Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, and C.
