# Delete Instance
Depending on your business changes, you can manually delete the instance whose billing type is pay by configuration.

## Precautions
- The operation of deleting can only be performed when the instance status is “running”.
- If the instance is deleted, all read-only instances under this instance and backup will be deleted synchronously.

## Operation Steps
1. Log in to the distributed database TiDB management console.
2. There are two ingresses for deleting the instance, which are:
	- List: Select the **target instance required to be deleted** and click **More -> Delete** which is in the column - **Operate**.
	- Instance Detail page: Select the **target instance required to be deleted**, go to the Instant Detail page and click **Operate** -> **Delete** at the upper right corner of the page.
3. Pop-up Box for Delete Confirmation
