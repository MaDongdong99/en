The deployment source of succeeded deployment in history under the application is listed in the milestone page.

**What is a milestone**

The deployment source (program package) successfully deployed in history will be remarked as the milestone and will be automatically added to the milestone page. A function used for viewing the deployment condition from the view of the program package is provided.

The specified milestone can support the following operation:

- Initiate Deployment: Initiate deployment by specifying the milestone. For details, please refer to "Operation Guide-Initiate Deployment"
- Deletion: Delete the milestone

For details, please refer to "Operation Guide-Application Deployment Group List" in the deployment group page.
