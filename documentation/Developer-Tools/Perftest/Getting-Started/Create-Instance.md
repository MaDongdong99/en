# Create Script
## Example Script
To facilitate rapid experience, we have prepared a simple example script to users (corresponding tested targets have been prepared). You can skin the step of preparing script and directly run the example script.
The example script will adopt the concurrent pressure machine itself as the tested target, concurrently access static resources on web servers and monitor resource usage of concurrent pressure machine at the same time (Note: For tested system monitoring, the user needs to select related Virtual Machines. But execution to example script is inapplicable)
