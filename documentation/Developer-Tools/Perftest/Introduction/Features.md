# Features
## Test Script/Test Execution Result Management
When JMeter scripts passed local debugging are uploaded to the service platform, different load tests can be initialized. Each execution record is saved in the platform for convenient calling, view, comparison and analysis. Scripts and execution results of different users are mutually separated to each other.
## Initialization of Test Execution
Designate different concurrent pressure scales, test duration and tested target to be monitored for scripts and then the second-level execution can be initialized. When the system redirects to the status dashboard, various performance indicators and monitoring data can be dynamically refreshed.
## View and Analysis of Test Result
Test details can be viewed both during and after test, mainly covering performance data, tested monitoring data and monitoring data of concurrent pressure system.
