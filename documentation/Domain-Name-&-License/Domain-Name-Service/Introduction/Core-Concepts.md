# Core Concepts

## Domain Name

A domain name is a string of names separated by dots. The name of a computer or group of computers on the Internet identifies the computer's electronic location (sometimes the geographic location) during data transmission.

When you need to access a website or web application, you need to enter the domain name in the address bar of Web browser. For example, use the domain name www.jdcloud.com to access the JD Cloud Service.

If you want your website or web application to be accessible on the Internet, you must register a domain name first.

## Top-Level Domain (TLD)

The last part of the domain name is .com, .cn, or .net. There are three types of top-level domains:

Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs). These TLDs usually let users know what they can find on the site. For example, .com stands for business enterprises, .net stands for network providers, and .org stands for non-profit organizations, etc.

Country Code Top-Level Domains (ccTLDs). These TLDs are related to geographic regions (such as countries/cities/regions), for example, .cn represents China, and .us represents America. Some registries of ccTLDs in some countries have requirements on address of registrants.

New gTLD. For example, .xyz represents generic, .top represents top-level, the .red represents red, and .men represents man.

## Domain Registrar

Domain registrars are designed to handle domain name registration services for TLD, and shall be the business entity or organization either recognized by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) or appointed by a ccTLD registration bureau.

## Domain Registry

A company that has the right to sell a domain name under a specific top-level domain. For example, Xinnet is a registry that has the right to sell domain names under the .com top-level domain. The domain registry can define rules for registering the corresponding domain name, such as limiting the address of the registrant's address for registration in a country code top-level domain name.

The domain registry is also responsible for maintaining an authoritative database of all domain names with the same TLD. The domain registry's database contains information such as domain name contacts and DNS servers of domain names.
