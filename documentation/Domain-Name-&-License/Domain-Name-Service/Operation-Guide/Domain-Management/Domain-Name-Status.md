# Domain Status

1. Pre-registration Status

After the domain name payment is complete, we will submit your registration information to the Registration Authority for review. In this state, the domain name is pre-registered. If the registered information is in the normal state after passing the registration authority, the domain name is normal. If your enrollment information contains non-routine information that may be rejected, we will return your payment amount to the balance. The moderate domain name pre-registration state is in the instantaneous state, not more than 5 minutes. If the domain name has been pre-registered and has been paid for success, please contact our customer service.

2. Interpretation of Domain Name Status in whois

When viewing the domain name whois, there is a "Domain Name Status" column. Each domain name has its current status and may have only one or more statuses. Understanding the meaning of various domain names helps you understand why the domain name is in different statuses and take appropriate and timely action.

There are the following cases: the status starting with client refers to be initiated by the registry, and the status starting with the server refers to be initiated by CNNIC (China Internet Network Information Center)

ACTIVE (OK): Normal status (normal, there is no need to perform immediate operations, and no protection measures are set; when there are other statuses, the OK status is not displayed, but it does not mean that it is not normal.)

INACTIVE: Inactive state (the domain name server is not set when registering and cannot be resolved)

The domain name registration information is protected. After the domain name is locked by security lock under some conditions, the following status will appear:

client Delete Prohibited: prohibited to be deleted as set by the registrar

server Delete Prohibited: prohibited to be deleted as set by the registration bureau

client Update Prohibited: prohibited to be modified as set by the registrar (the domain name information is not allowed to be modified, but the resolution record is allowed to be set or modified)

server Update Prohibited: prohibited to be modified as set by the registration bureau (the domain name information is not allowed to be modified, but the resolution record is allowed to be set or modified)

client Transfer Prohibited: prohibited to be transferred as set by the registrar (it is not allowed to be transferred as set by the registrar)

server Transfer Prohibited: prohibited to be transferred as set by the registration bureau (some domain name will be set under this state by the registration bureau after newly registered or transferred for 60 days, and the status will be relieved automatically after 60 days; and some domain names, because of relating to arbitration or lawsuit, will be set by the registration bureau, and the status will be relieved after the arbitration or lawsuit)

There are also some statuses that prohibit resolution and renewal:

client Renew Prohibited: prohibited to be renewed as set by the registrar (the failure of renewal of the domain name usually indicates that the domain name is under the arbitration or court dispute period, and the cause can be confirmed through contacting the registrars)

server Renew Prohibited: prohibited to be renewed as set by the registration bureau (the failure of renewal of the domain name usually indicates that the domain name is under the arbitration or court dispute period, and the cause can be confirmed through contacting the registrars)

client Hold: pause for resolution as set by the registrar, and the status can be relieved by contacting the registrar

server Hold: pause for resolution as set by the registration bureau (generally the reason is that domain name like .com, .cn, .net have not pass the real-name verification, and the status will be automatically relieved after the real-name verification)

pending Transfer: under transferring process

pending Verification: domain name verification period (the real-name verification is not completed after the registration of a domain name, and the materials shall be submitted for verification as early as possible and within 5 days, if failed, it will enter into Server Hold status)

3. Expiration Status of Domain Name

A. Within 1 to 45 days after the domain name expires, it will be in the REGISTRAR HOLD status (under retention by the registrar):

B. After the registrar's retention period, the domain name will enter a 30-day redemption period and will be in REDEMPTION PERIOD (grace period).

C. After the redemption period, the domain name will enter the 6-day deletion pending period. After the expiration of 6 days, the domain name will be deleted and will be in PENDING Delete, meaning during the deletion process. It will be opened and available for re-registered after deletion.

D. REGISTRAR/REGISTRY LOCK is the registrar/local domain lock status, which prevents the domain name from being transferred from the registrar after expiration.
