## Principle of HTTPDNS

Client directly accesses HTTPDNS interface to obtain optimized IP of domain.

After getting business IP, client directly sends business protocol requests to the IP.

Taking Http as an example, it may send standard Http requests to the IP of HTTPDNS by designating host field in header.
