## Mobile Application Scenarios

HTTP DNS replaces the default domain resolution mode of mobile APPs and desktop applications with domain resolution via HTTP protocol to avoid the user network access exceptions caused by the Operatorâ€™s Local DNS service exceptions.
 It mainly applies to the development of the following types of mobile APPs:

Information and Game APP
 Hope to reduce access delay and reduce cross-network access, and also pay attention to quick response experience.

E-commerce APP
 Hope to reduce connection failure rate and improve business operating rate, and pay attention to the stability of access request.

Social APP
 Hope to smooth user access as the domain is hijacked for several times.

Audio and Video APP
 Improve connection success rate for playing music and video as such APPs require high smoothness.
