# Hyperlink Setting of ICP License No.

### Adding ICP License No. Hyperlink to Website

After the website is licensed, you need to edit the webpage source code when enabling the website so as to place the subject license number or ICP license number issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology at the bottom of the webpage, and enable such subject license number or ICP license number to link to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology website: [http://www.beian.miit.gov.cn](http://www.beian.miit.gov.cn/).

Because each website is constructed in different ways, we will not introduce the specific operation steps to add an ICP license number on the site and the website IT personnel need to do this job by themselves.

In case of failure of adding the ICP license number at the bottom of the website, a fine above RMB 5,000 and below RMB 10,000 may be imposed by relevant departments. We take the official website of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (beian.miit.gov.cn) for example to show the effect of adding a ICP license No. to the website

·     The ICP license No. "Beijing ICP License No. 04000001" is added at the bottom of the website

·     The ICP license No. is linked to the website of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and will redirect to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology by clicking it to search and confirm the license information.
