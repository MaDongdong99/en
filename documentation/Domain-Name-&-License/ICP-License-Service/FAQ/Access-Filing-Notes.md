Where your domain which directs to JD Cloud Public IP has been filed in the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (i.e. filed by other access provider) and hasnâ€™t been filed by JD Cloud, you need to submit and complete access filing process at the JD Cloud filing platform. In the access filing process, the domain will not be held up by filing.

**Access filing can be divided into two types depending on the business scenario:**

1. Additional Access

To access filing information of other service provider to JD Cloud, please continue access filing operation.
