If such conditions are met, the system will display the contents as follows, and then please click **Apply** on the right.

### Description: Authorization code has 4 statuses that are unused, licensing, used, and invalid

 **Unused indicates that the authorization code did not be used.**

 **Licensing indicates that if the authorization code is used by other users, the system will prompt "Authorization Code Has Been Used" when you use it again; if other users quit license, the authorization code is unavailable for reuse.**

 **Used indicates that the license information submitted for the authorization code has been approved, that is, it is used and cannot be used again.**

 **Invalid indicates that the authorization code has been disabled and therefore is invalid.**
