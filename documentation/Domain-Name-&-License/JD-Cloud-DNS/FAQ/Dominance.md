## **Explicit URL and Implicit URL**

Explicit URL Forwarding:

For example: http://b.com/ points to http://a.com/example/ (any directory); when typing http://b.com/ in the browser address bar and click enter, the address displayed in the address bar of IE browser will automatically change from http://b.com/ you typed in first into the true target address http://a.com/example/;

Implicit URL Forwarding:

For example: http://b.com/ points to http://a.com/example/ (any directory); when typing http://b.com/ in the browser address bar and click enter, the address shown in the address bar of IE browser remains the same at http://b.com/, but the actual content accessed is at http://a.com/xxx/.
