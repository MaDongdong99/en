- # Benefits

  **High Availability**

  The core of cloud resolution service adopts self-developed high-performance resolver, and the industry-leading cluster technology solutions are used within nodes to circumvent the impact of single machine faults on services. Through the deployment of multiple nodes, it is distributed in the core backbone nodes of operators to achieve remote disaster tolerance. At the same time, relying on JD Cloud network protection platform, as well as multi-year operation assurance experience of online store's Domain Name Service, it provides users with high available (99.9999%) services.

  **High Performance and Top Speed**

  The high-performance DNS kernel has greatly improved resolution speed and processing power, and is 100 times more efficient than open-source bind. Rely on multi-node line BGP lines and multi-node advantages to achieve lower resolution delays and help optimize your website service experience.

  **Safety**

  It provides the JD Cloud super bandwidth room, strong DDOS protection system protection, as well as more than 200G DNS protection capacity for your website protection. At the same time, the HTTPDNS interface is provided externally, and the customer can perform domain name resolution through the http protocol, effectively avoiding the problem of domain name hijacking. The HTTPDNS service uses BGP line to access, so that the access delay is smaller.

  **Real-time Validation**

  Through the cloud resolution management platform, domain name management operations (such as adding new domain names, resolution changing) take effect in seconds, and it supports a minimum 1 second TTL value to help you achieve fast traffic scheduling and reduce losses.
