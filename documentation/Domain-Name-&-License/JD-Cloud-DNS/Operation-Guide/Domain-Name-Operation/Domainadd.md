  Rule to add domain name :

  路         The legal character length is 1-63 characters (the domain name subject). If the suffix is illegal, it prompts illegal.

  路         The English domain name legal characters are az, 0-9, "-" (not at the beginning and end, and not in the third and fourth character positions at the same time).

  路         The Chinese domain name contains at least one Chinese character (Simplified or Traditional) in addition to the legal character of the English domain name. The character length of Chinese domain name is based on the converted Punycode encoded string.

  路         Inputs of "xn-at the beginning" are not supported. Tip: This format is not supported. For the Punycode code, please enter the Chinese domain name.
