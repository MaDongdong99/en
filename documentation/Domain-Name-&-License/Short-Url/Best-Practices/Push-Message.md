# Use Short URL in Message Push System

### Business Scenarios

Messages sent to users via the mobile message push system contain rich contents, but some long link url may be too long, which has over one hundred characters. It is apt to emerge problems in client display, so switching display is required.

### Solutions ###

Using a short URL to replace the original long link in the message can largely reduce the message display difficulty and increase the aesthetics of message style.
