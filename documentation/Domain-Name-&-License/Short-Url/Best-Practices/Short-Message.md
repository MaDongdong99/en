# Short URL for Short Message

### Business Scenarios

Short messages have a strict requirement for the control of word number. If the content in one short message exceeds the limited word number, it will be sent in two or more short messages; therefore, the cost will largely increase. It is a very important issue on how to transmit more contents to client in one single short message.

### Solutions

Using a short URL can transmit more information with a limited quantity of characters, provide more space for copywriting and make client demonstration more tidy and elegant.

### For specific implementation

- Issuing similar or same short messaged through the platform to a mass of users, including the same short URL, will have a lower frequency, e.g. 1~2 times/day

  Short URLs can be generated through the page, replicated to the content in the short message sending platform and sent out. It is simple, quick and convenient.

- Sending customized short messages for various users, including different short URLs, will have a higher frequency, reaching hundreds ~ tens of thousands times/day

  It can be simply and conveniently called through APIs and assessed with SDK, quickly linking to the short message system.
