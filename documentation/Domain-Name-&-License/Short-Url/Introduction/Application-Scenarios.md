# Application Scenarios

- **One Link for One Customer**

Customized services will be provided according to different users. Each user will use separate website to avoid too long parameters by using short URLs.



- **SMS Notification**

Using a short URL in short message with strict requirement for word number can largely save the word number of the contents and reserve more space for the text, thus to save the cost of short message.



- **Message Notification**

Using a short URL to notify mobile messages can optimize the display on user side in a clear and legible way, making users more easily accept to assess.



- **Product Promotion**

Using a short URL for each independent product link address makes it easier for merchants to promote the product and place it in various channels.
