# Product Overview

The short URL service is a service that converts long links to short links and restores short links to long links. Short links are more convenient for transmission and storage, and can solve problems such as too long addresses contained in customer information distribution, notification and advertisement links, poor link text format, high content costs and help customers quickly build their own content distribution platforms and applications.
