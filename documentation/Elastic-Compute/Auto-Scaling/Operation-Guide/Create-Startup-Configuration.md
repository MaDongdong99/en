# Create Launch Configuration

If you need to start Auto Scaling services, you are required to create a Launch Configuration first.

## Operation Steps

A Launch Configuration defines the configuration information used for the VM instance of the Auto Scaling, including image, storage, bandwidth, login mode, and other configuration information for the VM.
Log in to the Auto Scaling Console, and click the **Launch Configuration** in the Navigation bar.
