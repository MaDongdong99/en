# **Service Free of Charge**

The Auto Scaling service is currently free of charge.

You only need to pay for other services associated with Auto Scaling, such as automatically creating or manually adding VM instances through Auto Scaling; For more information about the VM prices, please see [VM Purchase Notes](https://www.jdcloud.com/help/detail/290/isCatalog/1). Please note that a Pay-By-Consumption VM will still be charged for its instance after it is stopped and will no longer be charged only until it is released.

Description: The Auto Scaling will try to ensure that your Auto Scaling service is popped up in full in a normal manner, however, you are implored to understand, recognize and be aware of the circumstance where an instance of Auto Scaling cannot be fully popped up due to insufficient inventory of Cloud Servers, long start time and other issues.
