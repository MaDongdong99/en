# Configure Self-Starting

When the Availability Group is applied, instances within one Availability Group usually provide the same service. We suggest you configure the self-starting for the application wthin the instances and create private image based on this instance, which is also used for instance template creation to be associated to the Availability Group. Configuration method differs according to different operation system versions. Please make your choice according to your specific service requirement:
