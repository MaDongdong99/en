# Product Overview

Availability Group (AG) is a business availability deployment solution provided by JD Cloud, which is a logical collection of computing resources. It provides a mechanism for balanced deployment of VMs across multiple fault domains (FDs) in a data center. The instances are dispersed in isolated physical hosts. In case of hardware failure , it will only affect some instances, and your business is still available. Fault isolation between fault domains avoids the overall impact of partial failures on availability applications.

**Free Use**, the relevant fees are collected according to the resources in the group. It will support container type Availability Group soon.
