# Product Overview

Availability Group (AG) is a business availability deployment solution provided by JD Cloud, which is a logical collection of computing resources. It provides a mechanism for balanced deployment of intra-group units across multiple fault domains (FDs) in a data center. The instances are dispersed in isolated physical resources. In case of hardware failure or fixed maintenance, it will only affect some instances, and your business is still available. Fault isolation between fault domains avoids the overall impact of local failures on availability applications.

**Free Use**, the relevant fees are collected according to the resources in the group. It will support container type Availability Group.
