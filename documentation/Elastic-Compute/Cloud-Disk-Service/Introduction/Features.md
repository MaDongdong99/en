### Independent storage service ###

Cloud disk provides high-reliability, high-availability and high-performance data storage service

1. Cloud disk data are independent from the virtual machine status, support attaching and detaching at any time; a single virtual machine may be attached with up to 4 cloud disks to meet higher storage demands of users;

2. You only need to pay for the current capacity and type of the cloud disk, and may expand the cloud disk capacity at any time based on business development;

3. Provide real-time monitoring on cloud disk IOPS and throughput, and master the hard disk health status at any time.

### Snapshot backup ###

Cloud disk provides snapshot function to realize data backup at specified time points

1. Snapshot is a full copy of cloud disk, including the data image of the disk from creation time point to backup time point, to store it in a redundant manner;

2. If you find any data loss or inconsistency caused by misoperation, attack or tempering, etc., you may rollback the snapshot so that your business recovers the status at the snapshot time point;

3. Back up the virtual machine, and simultaneously create a snapshot for the cloud disk attached to the virtual machine; One or more virtual machines with the same configuration as the current virtual machine can be quickly reproduced based on virtual machine image and cloud disk snapshot, so as to realize quick bulk deployment of business.

### Elastic expansion ###

Elastic expansion ensures that you may expand the capacity of cloud disk based on demands at any time

1. You may expand the cloud disk capacity as needed, to meet storage demands of different business requirements;

2. When cloud disk is created based on snapshot, the cloud disk may be configured with storage space larger than or equal to the snapshot capacity, to meet your demands to run business based on snapshot data, and you may also be provided with large storage space.
