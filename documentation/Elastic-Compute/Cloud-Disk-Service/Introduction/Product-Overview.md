**Cloud disk overview**


Cloud disk is a low-delay, high-persistence and high-reliability data block-level storage provided by JD Cloud for virtual machine. Data in cloud disk are stored in multiple real-time copies to prevent data unavailability due to component failure while providing you with high-availability data storage service. Elastic expansion is allowed for cloud disk capacity. You can expand data storage space at a low price in a few minutes to achieve persistent storage of your data.

Cloud disk may be attached to any running virtual machine in the data center where the cloud disk is located. Cloud disk is generally suitable for data requiring frequent updating (such as file system, log, database, etc.), and has the high-availability, high-reliability and high-performance characteristics.

Based on different performances and physical devices, cloud disk is divided into two types, i.e. SSD cloud disk and Premium Hdd cloud disk. You may purchase, upgrade and management your cloud disk through the console.


**Cloud disk snapshot over view**


Cloud disk snapshot is the data backup of a certain cloud disk at a certain time point. It is a data backup method provided by JD Cloud. The life cycle of cloud disk snapshot is independent from cloud disk, without occupying the userâ€™s storage space.

Currently you need to create snapshots for cloud disk manually regularly as data backup of cloud disk, in order to respond risks of data loss due to misoperation, attack or virus and others.

You may create a new disk based on snapshot, so that the new cloud disk contains all data in the snapshot and quick business deployment is achieved.
