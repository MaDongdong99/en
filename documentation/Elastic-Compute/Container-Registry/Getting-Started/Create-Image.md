    `docker login -u jdcloud -p ********* myregistry-cn-north-1.jcr.service.jdcloud.com `
 4. Push images to JD Cloud repository, for example ubuntu:latest for the local images.  
    Mark the local images to be pushed to the JD Cloud repository:
    `
    docker tag ubuntu:latest myregistry-cn-north-1.jcr.service.jdcloud.com/myrepo:latest
    `  
    Push the marked images to the JD Cloud repository:  
    `
    docker push myregistry-cn-north-1.jcr.service.jdcloud.com/myrepo:latest
    `
 5. Fetch images from the JD Cloud repository:  
    `
    docker pull myregistry-cn-north-1.jcr.service.jdcloud.com/myrepo:latest
