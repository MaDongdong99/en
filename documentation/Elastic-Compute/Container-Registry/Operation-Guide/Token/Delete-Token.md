# Deletion of Token

 1. Turn on the console, log in [Elastic Compute-Container Registry-Registry](https://cns-console.jdcloud.com/host/containerregistry/list), and click **Release Token**.
 2. Two release ways are supported, i.e. releasing all available tokens and releasing specified tokens by entering token names. Click **OK** to complete deletion.

**Note: when the tokens are released, the Docker client authorization via verification of corresponding tokens will be invalid.**
