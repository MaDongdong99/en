# Benefits

In the traditional cloud service pattern, before deploying and running new business, users need to pay attention to the allocation and scheduling of cloud resources, the construction and upgrading of business running environment, these underlayer construction and maintenance often take a lot of time and effort and require constant investment to optimize.

For Serverless computing service provided by Function Service, users do not need to care about everything related to the underlayer resources such as the server. Users only need to care about the core business-related code and host it in Function Service, which provides the running environment required for the code and calls enough resources at any time to meet the running load of the code.

## Low operation and maintenance cost

The code can be run without preconfiguring or managing the server, and there is no need for any resource management, so that operation and maintenance costs can be reduced comprehensively.

## Auto Scaling

Resource allocation is automatically scaled based on business concurrency, from several requests per day to hundreds of requests per second, and resource scaling is transparent to users without perception. 

## Pay on demand

It only needs to pay for the resource consumption actually executed by the code. There is no charge when the code is not running, and the pay on demand is implemented.
