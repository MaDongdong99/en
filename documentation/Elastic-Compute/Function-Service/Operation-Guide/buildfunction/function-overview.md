# Function Overview

A function is a combination of code, runtime, resources, and settings required to implement a function. It is the smallest unit that can run independently. The function is triggered by a trigger, which is subject to auto scaling according to the business requirements to implement the expected function.

 
See Table 1 for the details when the function supported by Function runs.
