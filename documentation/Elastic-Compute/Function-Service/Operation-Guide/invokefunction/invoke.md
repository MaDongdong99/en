# Function Invoke


## Invoke Type

You can invoke a function by 2 methods of **synchronous invoke** or **asynchronous invoke**.

Synchronous invoke: The result is returned directly after the event is processed by the function. For example: console invoke, API Gateway invoke are synchronous invoke.

Asynchronous invoke: The event is returned after being written into the message queue, and the client does not care about the result of the requested invoke. For example: OSS trigger invoke is the asynchronous invoke.

Synchronous/asynchronous requests have different restrictions on incoming events, for details, please refer to [Restrictions](../../Introduction/Restrictions.md).

 

## Concurrent Execution

Concurrent Execution means the number of simultaneous executions of your function code at any given time. The function concurrency can be estimated through the following formula.

**Request Rate * Function Execution Time**

In which, the request rate is the rate at which a function is invoked, and the unit is "the number of requests per second" or "the number of events per second". The unit of function execution time is "second". For example, consider one function that processes an API Gateway event of JD Cloud. Assuming that the function takes an average time of 2 seconds, API Gateway releases 10 events per second. Therefore, your function has 20 concurrent executions.

 

## Security Restrictions

In some cases, function execution may get out of control due to wrong settings of the user. Referring to the following scenario, you set up an OSS trigger that will invoke the relevant function to process after uploading the image file to a certain Bucket in OSS. This function processes the original image into images of three different sizes and mistakenly writes the results back under the same bucket. As a result, new functions will be invoked to form an endless loop. To avoid financial losses due to out-of-control functions, function compute sets concurrent execution restrictions at each account granularity, the default is 100. You can observe the flow control behavior through the relevant indicators (Throttles) of the function in the cloud monitoring.



 

## Try Again Mechanism

Based on different invoke methods, the try again mechanisms for unsuccessful functions vary.

Synchronous invoke: If functions under the synchronous invoke fail to execute, the system will not process. You can try again by yourself.

Asynchronous invoke: If your function asynchronous invoke fails, Function will try again automatically and wait until to be executed.
