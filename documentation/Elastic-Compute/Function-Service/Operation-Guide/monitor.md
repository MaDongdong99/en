# Function Monitoring

Function Service collects function indicators in real time through cloud monitoring and displays function execution information.

**Function Monitoring**

Currently, Function Service provides Function Monitoring for the Function dimension, and the monitoring items are shown in Table 1.

| TotalInvocations    | Times   | The total times of requests that Invoke the Function, including all requests that invoke the InvokeFunction interface for access and requests that the system performs asynchronous Invoke. Asynchronous Invoke requests, which start counting when actually executed by the system. |
| BillableInvocations | Times   | Times of Invoking the Function successfully, such requests are billable requests, including function syntax errors or running errors. |
| Throttles           | Times   | Times of requests that Invoke the Function but are subject to the flow control.                          |
