# Version
With version management, you can release multiple versions of functions to serve different environments and implement iteration and upgrade of each environment version. The default version of Function Creation is LATEST version, and each function has a LATEST version. When the function code is stable, release operation can be done, changes of the release revision are not allowed.

Suggestion: You can use the function version service for on-line requests that is released after tested stable, and continue to develop tests on the LATEST version to ensure smooth running of the business.
