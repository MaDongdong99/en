# Version Management

## Function Version and Alias

 
Function Service provides function version management for users to manage function code in development, testing, and production environments. With Function version control, you can release one or more versions of Function so that different versions of Function can be used in different phases or environments.

 

Function also supports creating aliases for each version of the function, which are pointers to a particular version of Function. You can roll back to any previous version of Function with the alias.
