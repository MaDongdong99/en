**Working node**: The Virtual Machine instance with Kubernetes components, such as Docker Engine, Kubelet and network plug-ins, must be registered to a cluster, which can be used for deploying and managing containers only when such instance is available.  
**Working node group**: A group of working node sets with the same configuration.
