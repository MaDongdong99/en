# Deploy Private Image Container Registry

Private Image Container Registry
    Private Image Container Registry can be a unified platform for customer to store and manage inner container images and can provide better performance, safety and manageability compared with public Container Registry. Harbor is a enterprise-level Registry server for Docker image storage and distribution, with Harbor as an example as follows.



Installation Steps:

1. Create VM instance
    Create a VM in the JD Cloud Console and refer to the creation of Linux instance for details.

Deploy selection of regions according to container and select the same region or nearer regions. At present, the container is online only in cn-north-1 and we choose to Create VM instance in cn-north-1.

Operation system, recommended to use Ubuntu 16.04 or Centos 7.4

The VM shall be configured minimally to 2 cores 4GB and 4 cores 8GB is suggested.

Bandwidth may affect the download speed of image, the larger the bandwidth is, the faster the download speed, and can be determined comprehensively according to the size of image and the quantity of images that are created in batch.
    Created a VM with 114.67.241.169 as its public address. Log in VM in the root mode.

2. Deploy Docker
    Ubuntu 16.04 Deployment method


apt-get update
apt-get -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/docker-ce/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -
add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/docker-ce/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
apt-get update
apt-get install -y docker-ce
    Centos 7.4 Deployment Method

yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2
yum-config-manager --add-repo https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/docker-ce/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
yum makecache fast
yum -y install docker-ce
service docker start
3. Install Docker-Compose
    Ubuntu 16.04 Deployment method

apt-get   install python-pip –y
pip install docker-compose
Centos 7.4 Deployment Method


yum install python-pip –y
pip install docker-compose
4. Download and unzip Harbor



wget   http://harbor.orientsoft.cn/harbor-v1.4.0/harbor-offline-installer-v1.4.0.tgz
tar xf  harbor-offline-installer-v1.4.0.tgz
5. Apply for Https certificate
    You may apply for free certificate in https://freessl.org/. Take domain harbortest.jdpoc.com for example; it is required that the domain points to the IP address of Create VM instance 114.67.241.169.
    If there is not a domain name, apply for a domain name from domain name service of JD Cloud.
    Apply for domain
    Get a certificate
    CA certificate and all the contents of it shall be stored in /data/cert/server.crt; the content of private key shall be stored in /data/cert/server.key.



cd ..
mkdir -p /data/cert
cd /data/cert
vim server.crt
vim server.key
cd ..
cd ..
cd root
6. Deploy Harbor
    Modify Harbor settings


cd harbor
vim harbor.cfg

The following four parameters are required to be modified with modified content marked in red as follows

   i.      It is modified to domain address of the user.

hostname = harbortest.jdpoc.com

  ii.      Modified to https; JD Cloud uses https protocol to encrypt the transmitting for relevant information of Container Registry, therefore, it is required to support https

ui_url_protocol = https

iii.      To be safe, the customer is suggested to change the password.

harbor_admin_password = ********

  iv. Turn off the account register function. The new user can be created only by administrator account.

self_registration = off

7. Apply Harbor to create private image Container Registry


Create private items

Log in harbor website and select New Item with test as item name; do not choose Public as access level.

    Create Image
    Create Directory

mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/harbortest.jdpoc.com
    It is required to copy the key pair of the domain name /root/cert/server.crt to the created directory /etc/docker/certs.d/harbortest.jdpoc.com
    This machine may use following commands

cp /data/cert/server.crt !$
    Login Harbor

docker login harbortest.jdpoc.com
image.png
    Successful login

8. Create and upload image
    Create Dockerfile file



mkdir nginx-dockerfile
cd nginx-dockerfile
vim Dockerfile
    Dockerfile with contents as follows:



FROM nginx
RUN echo '<h1>Hello, JD Cloud!</h1>' > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
EXPOSE 80
Remark:
       The Dockerfile includes two instructions:

　　FROM: Essential command, take certain image as base image; take centos for example. For example FROM <image_name>, or FROM <image_name>: <tag>. If not added tag, is latest by default. Seek for base image in local Container Registry at first, if there is none, query in docker registry online.

　　RUN: When creating new images, command in the system can be executed, for example, install certain software and setup environment variables.

　　EXPOSE: Open ports in the container, but do not map host machine. Facilitate to carry on development and test on host machine. In the format of: EXPOSE <port1> [<port2>...]
       Besides FROM, RUN, EXPOSE instructions, there are following common instructions:

　　ENV: Setup system environment variables with two formats ENV <key> <value>；ENV <key1>=<value1> <key2>=<value2>...
       MAINTAINER: Indicate the author of Dockerfile and his contact information
       CMD: Set the command to be executed, often for an operation that is specified when the Container starts. Such as executing customized script services, or executing system commands. There can only be one CMD, and if there are more than one CMD in Dockerfile, only the last CMD takes effect. In the format of: CMD <command>
    Execute build to create image

docker build -t newnginx .
     Upload image
    Play Tag for Image

docker tag newnginx harbortest.jdpoc.com/test/newnginx:latest
    push image to private image Container Registry

docker push harbortest.jdpoc.com/test/newnginx:latest
9. Deploy Container
    Add secrets to secrets of container service

Create Container


The Container Instance List page after successful creation, with the container at the public IP of 116.196.76.86



10. Access to container


Input http://116.196.76.86/ and get successful verification.


Instructions about the deploy of private image Container Registry:
1.         JD Cloud is responsible for relevant problems of VM created by JD Cloud. Refer to http://vmware.github.io/harbor/ for relevant problems of Harbor and more details.
