At present BGP is available only in cn-north-1.  
Bandwidth Range: 1Mbps~200Mbps, you may not purchase public IP for the moment during creating container instance and you may associate it after the container has been created.  
 The bandwidth cost of EIP is independent from instance cost. Refer to price of public IP for details.                           
 10. Advanced Setup  
Is not required item and provide advanced option for your creating container. You may selectively define options of advanced setup as required;  
Running command: Enter the first Entrypoint instruction when running the container which shall replace the Entrypoint instruction that is set in image;  
Running parameters: Enter the first CMD instruction when starting the container which shall replace the CMD instruction that is set in image; if Entrypoint instruction has been set in command which is already running, this instruction shall be added to parameters of Entrypoint instruction to be executed;  
Environment variables: Environment variables for container running. You may set multiple groups of environment variables for each container, however, the key of environment variables must be corresponding to the value of environment variables one to one in each group; env command may be used to check the environment variables of the container; click + button and add a group of environment variables; click “delete” to delete a group of environment variables;
