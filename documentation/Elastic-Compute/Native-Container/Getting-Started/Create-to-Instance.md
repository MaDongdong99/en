# Create Container Instance

**Preconditions**

1. Before creating a container instance, you need to complete the following steps  
2. Register a JD Cloud account, activate and verify the same, to respectively access JD Cloud registration, JD Cloud Login and Real-name Verification.  
3. If you need to create the billing instances paid by configuration, you need to keep your balance above RMB 50. If the balance is less than the limit, please recharge your account.  
4. You must create a virtual private cloud and a subnet first;  
5. If you need IAM for an instance using a security group, you can pre-create a security group or reconfigure the outbound and inbound rules of a security group.  

**Action Steps**

 1. Open Console, select Elastic Compute>>Container Service>>Container Instance;  
 2. Select the region where the container instance to be created is located, and click **Create** button to access to the container instance purchase page; it is recommended that you choose the region where the instance is located and the availability zone according to the business situation.  
 Note: Currently, it supports cn-north-1 and cn-east-2 regions and offers two availability zones as availability zone A and availability zone B; as for the online time of other regions, please wait.  
 3. Select billing model: monthly package and pay by configuration; as for monthly package, pay monthly to purchase resource and as for pay by configuration, billing is made as per the length of time actually used (accurate to seconds). Regarding the difference between the two billing methods, please refer to the billing rules.  
 4. Selection of region and availability zone: In this step, you can still select the area corresponding to the container (cn-north-1) and the availability zone. Please note that “The resource intranet in different regions is not interlinked, and cannot be changed after creation", if the selected region quota is full, the quota can be increased by open ticket.  
 5. Select image:  
 Repository: docker.io, or repository address corresponding to warehouse verification information. It is docker.io by default; select docker.io to create a container based on the public image provided by Docker Hub; after selecting the warehouse verification information, the container is created based on the public or private image provided by the corresponding Repository. When no warehouse authentication information is added, JD Cloud will use Docker Hub to obtain docker image by default; if a third-party private Repository is required, you will need to first add warehouse verification information to JD Cloud. Choose to add third-party Secrets to JD Cloud. Using a private image created in Docker Hub; when adding third-party warehouse verification, this address is recommended for domain name: https://index.docker.io     
 Image name: Enter the image name needed to create the container, for example: library/nginx  
 Image version: If you do not enter, the default version is latest; if you need another version, please enter the version name.  
 6. Select specification  
Configuration of JD Cloud VM support user customized selection: Provide 1 nucleus 1G to 56 nucleus 448G (the configuration of 32 nucleus 256G, 54 nucleus 112G, 54 nucleus 224G and 54 nucleus 448G currently has not opened yet); three types are available: general type, compute optimized type and memory optimized type; users can select instance type and corresponding configurations according to different business scenarios. Please refer to the instance configuration recommendation for details.  
To select other instance, please select the rules for replacement instance to select:  
 7. Storage: JD Cloud provides the cloud disk as the system disk and the data disk of the container, the cloud disk uses the one disk multi-standby distributed storage method with high data reliability.                
System disk: Currently only SSD cloud disks are supported with a capacity range of 10-100G; the system disk file system format supports xfs or ext4, to format the container's system disk according to the selected file system format when creating the container; the mounting directory of the system disk is the root directory "/" which cannot be modified; currently the system disk must be deleted with the container;    
Data disk: Support to mount seven data disks; Premium Hdd Cloud Disk and SSD cloud disk are available, only associated data disk is supports when creating.      
Premium Hdd Cloud Disk as data disk: support range 20G~3000G   
SSD cloud disk as data disk: support range 20G~1000G  
The cost of the cloud disk is independent from the instance; please refer to the price of the cloud disk for specific price information.  
 8. Select network  
Select **Virtual Private Cloud** and **Subnet**, after selecting Subnet, you can judge the VM number that may be created under the Subnet; if there is no Subnet currently, you may create a new Subnet through fast entrance and select in “Virtual Machine Network”. Please refer to virtual private cloud and subnet for details.  
Private IP: There are two modes for automatic allocation and customization. It is automatic allocation by default; the private IP will be automatically assigned by the system to the container and cannot be modified; customization is available, you need to enter the private IP, the IP address within the IP scope of the intranet specified by your subnet CIDR; if a customized private IP is selected, batch creation of container instances is not supported for the time being.  
Select the corresponding created security group, which is a must; security group can also be created through a quick entry. Please refer to Create Security Group for details; after the creation, select in the “Network".   
 9. Bandwidth:  
The EIP bandwidth type provided by JD Cloud is billing by fixed bandwidth and billing by traffic; Billing by fixed bandwidth is based on the bandwidth cap value set at the time of purchase, regardless of your instance’s current real-time access to public network bandwidth; while billing by traffic is based on the actual traffic of your real-time access to the public network. Currently only BGP is available in cn-north-1.  
Bandwidth range is: 1Mbps~200Mbps. During the process of creating container instance, it is allowed not to purchase EIP temporarily; do not bind before the creation of container.  
 The costs for EIP bandwidth is independent from those of the instance. Please refer to the price of the EIP for specific price information.                           
 10. Advanced Settings  
It is not a compulsory item, which provides advanced options for you to create containers. You can optionally define options in advanced settings as needed;  
Running command: Enter the first Entrypoint instruction that runs when the container is started, which will replace the Entrypoint instruction set in the image;  
Running parameter: Enter the first CMD instruction that runs when the container is started, which will replace the CMD instruction set in the image; if the Entrypoint instruction has been set in the running command, the instruction will be appended to the parameter of the Entrypoint instruction for execution;  
Environment variable: Set the environment variable at the container running time. You can set multiple sets of environment variables for each container, and the keys and values of each set of environment variables must correspond one by one; after the container starts, you can use the env command to view the container's environment variable; click **+** to add a set of environment variable, and click **Delete** to delete a set of environment variable;  
Working directory: Set the container’s working directory. Container’s working directory must be absolute path, starting with “/” and cannot contain “:”, “.” characters; if not set, use the root directory "/" as the container's working directory by default.  
Machine name: Set the machine name of the container; if not set, use the container ID as the machine name;  
Startup item: click the button to open or close TTY; by default TTY is closed; after opening, a pseudo terminal will be assigned to the container to print the container's Stdin, Stdout and Stderror information.  
 11. Domain name and IP mapping  
It is not a compulsory item, to add a set of domain names and IP mapping to the container hosts file; Click **Delete** to delete a set of domain names and IP mapping; click **+** to add a set of domain names and IP mapping.  
 12. Basic Information  
Name: a compulsory item, and only supports Chinese, numbers, capital and lowercase letters, English underline “_” and line-through “-”, and cannot exceed 32 characters; if the purchase is created in bulk, the names are displayed as "xxx1" and "xxx2" in turn.   
Description: It is not a compulsory item; you can set them on demand, and the container description should not exceed 256 characters;  
 13. Confirm the number of containers and the purchase duration  
Purchase quantity is limited by your container, cloud disk, EIP quota in the region and the amount of IP remaining on the selected subnet. If the quota is not enough, you can increase the quota by open ticket.  
If you purchase a monthly package instance, the purchase duration shall be set, which is 1 month at shortest and 3 years at longest. Please open ticket if you need longer service duration.  
  14. After completion of container related configuration, click **Buy Now** to complete the payment and enter the Console>>Elastic Compute>>Container Service>>Container Instance, to view the container created.
