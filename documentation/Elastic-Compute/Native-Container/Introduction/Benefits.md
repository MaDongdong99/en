#  Benefits

Security isolation: Adopt independent kernel technology and base on the isolation of VM to avoid safety loophole of shared kernel among containers; realize complete isolation between different lessees basing on SDN technology.

Easy to use: No need to manage the cluster and study choreography tools, quick to use container and support Docker image, so that user can focus on applications; provide OpenAPI to improve use efficiency.

Flexible framework: In the same VPC, realize the intranet intercommunication between container instance and public cloud compute, storage, network and other resources to make full use of abundant product resources.

Abundant setup: Native container provide three instance family specifications including universal type, compute optimized type and memory optimized type. The instance support 1 core 1G settings in minimum and 56 cores 448G in maximum.

Flexible charge: Support two billing method including monthly package and pay by configuration. For pay by configuration, it shall adopt second-level charge and accumulate actual use time; the stopped status shall not be charged.
