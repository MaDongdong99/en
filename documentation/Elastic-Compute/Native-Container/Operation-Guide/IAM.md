## IAM

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a user identity management and resource access control service provided by JD Cloud. User can use IAM to create, manage sub-user and control the operation permission of JD Cloud resources for them. The primary account can use IAM to authorize resources in the management account to others without sharing account password or access secret key and assign minimum permissions for the users as required to reduce the security risks of enterprise information. Now, the Native Container Instance and Pod are supported. Creation of sub-account is not supported by the Console now.

For IAM, please refer to [IAM Help Documentation](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/iam/product-overview)
