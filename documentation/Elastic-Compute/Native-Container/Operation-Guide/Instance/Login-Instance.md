At present, the command line tool is provided by the Native Container Instance and Native Container Pod of JD Cloud to log in the container.

1. You need to download and install JD Cloud CLI. For details please refer to [CLI installation] [1];
2. JD Cloud supports two commands, i.e. attach and exec. You may attach a Native Container Instance by using the attach command or execute the command in the running container via the exec command; and for use method of the command line, please refer to [CLI Instructions] [2].

You may create the Native Container Instance or the Native Container Pod by using the Docker image supporting the SSH function and log in the container instance via the SSH method. For [How to Make and Support SSH function Image][3], please refer to the Help Center.
