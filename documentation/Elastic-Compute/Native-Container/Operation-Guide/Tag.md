## Tag

The tag is the tag of JD Cloud user to manage its own resource instance. You can classify resources by associating resources with tags, so as to manage your resources in JD Cloud more efficiently. Each tag comprises a "key" and a "value", e.g.: "User Department: Basic R&D Department", the "User Department" is the "key" of the tag, and the "Basic R&D Department" is the value of the "key". Each resource is allowed to be associated with 10 tags with different keys. Tags will not affect the instance but cannot be created independent from resource instances. When the last resource instance associated with a tag is deleted, the tag will also be deleted.  
Both Native Container Instance and Pod support the tag function.
