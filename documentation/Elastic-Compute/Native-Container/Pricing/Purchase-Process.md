Limitation of Elastic IP:

Each user can apply for 10 EIPs in each region; if you need to apply for more EIPs, you may request to increase the quota limit through opening ticket, and JD Cloud will increase the quota limit for you after evaluation based on your actual needs.

A single instance is allowed to be associated with only 1 EIP.

The bandwidth of the EIP purchased is the uplink bandwidth, i.e., the outgoing bandwidth.

An instance can be associated/disassociated with EIP repeatedly. To replace the EIP of an instance already associated with a EIP, you must get disassociated with the current associated EIP before getting disassociated with a new EIP.

The EIP under monthly package supports the upward adjustment of bandwidth; the EIP based on pay-by-configuration and pay-by-consumption supports the upward or downward adjustment of bandwidth.
