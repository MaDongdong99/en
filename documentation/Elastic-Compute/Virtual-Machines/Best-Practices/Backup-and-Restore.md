# Backup and Restoration

* Back up your cloud disks regularly with cloud disk snapshots and create private images from your instances to save the configuration as templates for launching future instances.
* Cross-region instance replication and backup can be realized through image replication to deploy critical services across multiple AZs.
* You can manually attach the ENI or EIP to the replacement instance to make a quick response to fault and shield the impact of the fault.
* Regularly test your instances and the restoration capability in a test environment in the case that the cloud disks have faults.
