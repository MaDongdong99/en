# Core Concepts
When you learn about the JD Cloud Virtual Machines, the following core concepts are usually involved:

Concept|introduction
:---|:---
Instance|Virtual Machines resources on JD Cloud.
Region and Availability Zone|physical deployment location instances and other resources.
Instance Type|The instance type identifies different instance configurations, including vCPU (core), memory (GB), storage, and network performance.
Image|The preset template for instance running environment, which contains the server's pre-configured environment (operating system and other installed software).
Local Disk|A device that is on the same physical server as the instance and can be used as a storage device by the instance.
Cloud Disk|A distributed persistent block storage device that can be used as a system disk or an expandable data disk of the instance.
VPC|customized virtual network space to achieve logical isolation between resources.
Elastic IP|EIP. It can dynamically associate/disassociate the EIP with the instance.
Security Group|Effective at the instance-level identity and access management, which can specify the IP, protocol, and port rules for incoming and outgoing instances.
JD Cloud Console|Web-based user resource management interface.
