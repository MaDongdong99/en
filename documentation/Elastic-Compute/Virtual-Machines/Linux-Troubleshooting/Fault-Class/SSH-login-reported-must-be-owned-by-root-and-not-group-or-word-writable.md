**Problem Phenomenon**

When the Linux VM starts the SSH service, an error message similar to the following appears:

*â€¢ /var/empty/sshd must be owned by root and not group or word-writable.*



**Problem Causes**

The permission configurations, groups, and the like for directories or files related to services of the SSH service should be stipulated based on security. This problem is usually caused by an exception in the associated permissions or group settings.

3. If the default permissions or groups are modified, you can modify them by the following instructions:


*chown -R root.root /var/empty/sshd* 

*chmod -R 711 /var/empty/sshd*


4. Use the following command to restart the SSH service and verify if the service can start normally:


*service sshd restart*


**Method II: /etc/securetty Directory Configuration Problems**
