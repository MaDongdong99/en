2. After designating the applicable product type (Virtual Machines/Container/POD), you can search the deduction conditions by instance voucher ID, instance ID or deduction time interval. When you purchase many instance vouchers for the same type family, the instance may use different instance vouchers at each settlement for deduction.<br>
The deduction amount is counted by hours, which means the amount of the same running period which is deducted within the billing cycle of the instance.
