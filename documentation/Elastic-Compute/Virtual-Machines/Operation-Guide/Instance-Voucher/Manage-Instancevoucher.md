# Manage Instance Voucher

## Renew
The instance voucher will become invalid once expired, which cannot be used to deduct consumption of instances paid by configuration any more. Renewal is not supported once expired. If you are sure to continue using, please complete the renewal before expiration.<br>
On the Instance Voucher List Page, select **Renew Resource** and click **Renew** to log in the renewal page and complete the renewal. For relevant operations of renewal, please refer to: [Renewal Management](https://docs.jdcloud.com/online-buying/renew-management).

## Delete
Only expired instance vouchers can be deleted. When a voucher expires, it will automatically become invalid and the quota occupied will be released, but it will not be deleted automatically. If you confirm that you do not need to keep the purchase record, you can delete it at the console at any time.
