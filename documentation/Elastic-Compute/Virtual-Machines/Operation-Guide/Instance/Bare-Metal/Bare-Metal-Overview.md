# Overview of Bare Metal Virtual Machines

The Bare Metal Virtual Machines are of a VM instance type launched based on JD Cloud & AIâ€™s new-generation self-developed virtualization technology architecture, which are equipped with both performance of physical machines and flexibility of virtual machines. Compared with the previous generation virtualization technology architecture, the new generation virtualization technology architecture no longer has any virtualization overhead. It provides physical level of resource isolation and supports nested virtualization. Your business can make direct access to computing resources on the Bare Metal Virtual Machines to secure your business.
 
## Product Features
*  Perfect performance: It has the same perfect performance as physical machines, providing network and storage with hardware acceleration capability, unintalling the original virtual network and storage protocol stack load from physical host machine to specified hardware without extra virtualization depletion, providing network bandwidth with speed over 10Gbit/s, and supporting nested virtualization
*  Security isolation: It provides hardware-level isolation and exclusive resources, which means you do not need to scramble for the resources of machines with other users on cloud
*  Delivery within minutes: It can deliver a Bare Metal Virtual Machine within minutes without advanced purchasing and manual intervention, which ensures in-time response to demand on business expansion
*  Seamless integration of cloud products: It is fully compatible with cloud products including VPC, cloud disk service, cloud database and cloud monitoring, providing complete cloud solutions
*  Consistent management experience: It supports console and SDK/OpenAPI/CLI operation, providing the same experience as ordinary Virtual Machines
