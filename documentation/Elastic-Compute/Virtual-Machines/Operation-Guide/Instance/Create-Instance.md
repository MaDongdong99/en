# Create Instance

You should specify information such as the instance type, image, VPC, security group, and login password when creating an instance. JD Cloud provides the user with a variety of ways to create an instance, including:

* [Create customized instance](Create-Instance#user-content-1)
* [Create instance by instance template (in beta) ](Create-Instance#user-content-2)
* [Create instance in Availability Group (in beta)](Create-Instance#user-content-3)


The customized instance creation also includes the clone instance.

## Create Customized Instance
The custom creation indicates that you need to customize the region, availability zone, instance type, image, VPC, security group, login password and so on based on your business scenarios. Depending on the types of operating system platforms, please refer to [Create Linux Instance](http://docs.jdcloud.com/cn/virtual-machines/create-linux-instance) and [Create Windows Instance](http://docs.jdcloud.com/cn/virtual-machines/create-windows-instance) for detailed creation steps.

### Clone Instance
You can create an instance of the same configuration as your current instance, including information such as the region, instance type, image, VPC, security group, etc., without including information such as the availability zone, login password, instance name, and description, etc. Clone instance is a quick customized creation method,

The detailed steps are as follows:

1. Access [Virtual Machines Console](https://cns-console.jdcloud.com/host/compute/list) and enter the instance list page. Or access [JD Cloud Console](https://console.jdcloud.com) Click navigation bar on the left **Elastic Compute** - **Virtual Machines** to enter the instance list page.
2. Select a region.
3. Select the instance in the list where you want to create within the same configuration, click Operate - More - Clone Instance, or click More - Clone Instance on the details page of the instance where you want to create within the same configuration to enter the instance creation page.
4. The creation method in the creation page is customized instance creation by default, and instance type, image, VPC, security group, etc. will be selected in the same configuration as the original instance by default, which you can change. In addition, you should select the availability zone, re-specify the login password, instance name, and description, etc. 
5. Click **Buy Now** to trigger the purchase. If you choose to create a monthly package billing instance, you will need to pay the fee.

		Please note:
		* Do not allow the creation of the same clone instance across regions, that is, only the same clone instance can be created in the current instance region;
		* If the private image used by the current Virtual Machines is deleted, you should re-specify the image;
		* The Clone Instance indicates that the new configuration information is the same, but the data in the instance is not replicated.
