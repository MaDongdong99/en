# Instance Overview

Instance is a cloud computing basic service unit provided by JD Cloud, which provides computing services with Auto Scaling processing capabilities. It contains all the required resources such as instance type (vCPU and memory), operating system, storage, network, security, etc. Each resource is available in various specifications to meet the individual needs of different services. Its management is simpler and more efficient than physical server. You can flexibly combine these resources according to actual needs. You can create a specified number of instances at any time through the console, OpenAPI or CLI. You can adjust the instance type at any time according to the business scale. Excess or idle resources can also be released to save input costs. JD Cloud Virtual Machines provide you with a stable and reliable foundation to realize rapid deployment of applications and enable you to focus on core business innovation.
