# Purchase Process
## Usage Restrictions
To ensure that the instance can be created smoothly, please check the instance service limits carefully before purchasing it. For details, please refer to [Service Limits](../Introduction/Restrictions.md).
## Precondition
### Account Preparation
Before you start creating an instance, you need to complete the registration of JD Cloud account and real-name verification, and get ready to pay for resources to be purchased.
### Registration
If you already have a JD Cloud account, you can skip this step for subsequent setting.
If you have not registered a JD Cloud account, you can register at JD Cloud official website, please refer to [Register JD Cloud](https://user.jdcloud.com/register).
### Account Verification
Real-name verification is a prerequisite for purchasing and using resources of JD Cloud. You can choose to perform personal real-name verification or enterprise real-name verification for the account. For details, see [Real-name Verification](../../../User-Service/Real-Name-Verification/Real-Name-Verification.md).
### Payment Preparation
If you purchase an instance billed with pay by configuration, since it is a pay-as-you-go mode, you should prevent your normal use of instances from impacting by failure of deduction of payment for resources due to insufficient account balance in the billing period. Therefore, to ensure your normal use, the sum of your account balance and available coupon will be no less than consumption threshold when you launch a pay-by-configuration instance. At the same time, you can estimate the cost according to the selected instance configuration and associated resource configuration as well as the use time and then recharge it to guarantee sufficiency of cash balance and available coupon.
If you purchase the monthly package instance, as the pay-in-advance mode is adopted, you will need to pay the full cost of the selected instance configuration for a specified life cycle, so you will need sufficient account balance (cash balance + amount of available coupons) or choose a third party payment to complete the payment at the time of payment.

If you want to know more about the billing rules, please refer to [Virtual Machines Billing Rules](Billing-Overview.md); if you want to know the specific cost under different configurations, different billing methods, and different purchase duration, you can go to [Price Calculator](https://www.jdcloud.com/calculator/calHost) for cost estimation.
