# Purchase Process
## Usage Restrictions
To ensure that the instance can be created smoothly, please check the instance service limits carefully before purchasing it. For details, please refer to [Service Limits](../Introduction/Limits.md).
## Precondition
### Account Preparation
Before you start creating an instance, you need to complete the registration of JD Cloud account and real-name verification, and get ready to pay for resources to be purchased.
### Registration
If you already have a JD Cloud account, you can skip this step for subsequent setting.
If you have not registered a JD Cloud account, you can register at JD Cloud official website, please refer to [Register JD Cloud](https://accounts.jdcloud.com/p/regPage?source=jdcloud&ReturnUrl=%2f%2fuc.jdcloud.com%2fpassport%2fcomplete%3freturnUrl%3d//www.jdcloud.com/).
### Account Verification
Real-name verification is a prerequisite for purchasing and using resources of JD Cloud. You can choose to perform personal real-name verification or enterprise real-name verification for the account. For details, see [Real-name Verification](../../../User-Service/Real-Name-Verification/Real-Name-Verification.md).
### Payment Preparation
If you are to purchase an instance billed by configuration, as the method of Pay-As-You-Go is adopted, to prevent deduction failure caused by insufficient account balance during the billing cycle, which in turn affects the normal use of the instance, the sum of your account balance and available coupons shall not be less than RMB 50 when you launch an instance billed by configuration to ensure normal use. Meanwhile, you can estimate the usage according to the configuration of selected instance, configuration of associated resources and usage duration fee and recharge it to ensure sufficient cash balance or available coupons.
If you purchase the monthly package instance, as the pay-in-advance mode is adopted, you will need to pay the full cost of the selected instance configuration for a specified life cycle, so you will need sufficient account balance (cash balance + amount of available coupons) or choose a third party payment to complete the payment at the time of payment.

If you want to know more about the billing rules, please refer to [Virtual Machines Billing Rules](Billing-Overview.md); if you want to know the specific cost under different configurations, different billing methods, and different purchase duration, you can go to [Price Calculator](https://www.jdcloud.com/calculator/calHost) for cost estimation.
