# Closed Event Tracker of Windows VM
An event tracer prompt box will pop up when you log in the Windows system Virtual Machines again after abnormal restart. Closed Event Tracker means that a "Closed Event Tracker" dialog box is displayed when the system is started again after abnormal shutdown to ask the user the causes for abnormal shutdown.
