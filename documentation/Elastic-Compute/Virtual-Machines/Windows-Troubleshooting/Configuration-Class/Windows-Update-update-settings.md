**Automatically Install Updates:**

Windows will automatically download updates and install them. The time to install the updates can be specified. The default is 3 am every day, and the user can customize the time to install the updates. If any of the updates require a restart of the computer to complete the installation, Windows will automatically restart the computer. (If the user logs in the computer while Windows is ready to restart, the user will be notified and can choose to delay the restart.)



**Download updates but let me choose whether to install them:**

Windows will look for updates suitable for your computer and download them in the background (in this process, users will not receive notices or be interrupted). Once the download is done, the icon will appear in the state area and a notice will be sent, informing the update installation. Click the icon or message to choose the updates to be installed.



**Check for updates, but let me choose whether to download and install updates:**

When Windows finds an update suitable for this computer, an icon will appear in the state area and a message stating that the update can be downloaded will pop up. Click the icon or message to select specific updates to be downloaded. Windows will then download the selected updates in the background. Once the download is completed, the icon will reappear in the state area and a notice will be sent, informing the update installation. Click the icon or message to choose the updates to be installed.



**Never Check for Updates:**

Windows does not check for available updates.
