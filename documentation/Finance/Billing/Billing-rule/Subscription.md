# Billing by Subscription

Billing by subscription refers to purchasing resources based on monthly package, charging according to the configuration and use time of the resources that you purchased, using firstly and paying later;


## Monthly Package
Monthly Package: Users can pay the charges for a month, several months or several years at a time. You can use the resources during the use time that you purchased, no needing to pay again, unless you need to make changes to the configuration or pay again in case of expiry;  
For example:  
If you purchase the cloud resources for six months at 10:00 a.m. on August 2nd, 2018, and the monthly unit price is CNY 56, then the fee you need to pay is CNY 336=6*56. You can use the resources until 23:59:59, February 2nd, 2019.


## Application Scenarios
When you have a stable business scenario and need to use cloud resources for a long time, it is recommended to buy resources based on monthly package, which can greatly save your cost.
