## Why electronic contract does not display JD Cloud official seal?

**The contract is in draft status**
Please find the corresponding contract on JD Cloud Cost Center-Contract Management page, click Convert to Formal Contract to convert the draft contract to the formal contract.
Complete JD Cloud electronic red seal displays at the signature position of the formal contract. Formal electronic contract has legal effect, which can be directly used. Please use Adobe Reader to view formal contract.
 
**The problem of your local reader**
If the formal contract does not display complete contract seal, the most possibility is that the reader does not support the display. The formal contract is in PDF format, please use Adobe Reader to view it. We recommend you change your reader to Adobe Reader (we do not recommend you use WPS software).

## Can the electronic contract be downloaded repeatedly?
Yes. At present, the electronic contracts are unlimited in number of downloads.

## Can we apply for contract repeatedly for the same order?
The order has unique relationship with the contract, so it cannot be applied for repeatedly. But the same formal contract can be downloaded without frequency limit.

## Will the contract applied for the unpaid order be invalid?
Yes. If the order is not paid within 15 days, it will be cancelled automatically. The contract is applied according to the order. If the order becomes invalid, the contract will be invalidated simultaneously. So, the contract corresponding to the order is valid for 15 days, too.

## Will the contract be invalid after order refund?
Yes. If you apply refund for the order, the contract will be automatically cancelled. The contract is applied according to the order. If the order becomes invalid, the contract will be invalidated simultaneously.
