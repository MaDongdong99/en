### **Use of Pay-As-You-Go**

1. The Pay-As-You-Go products such as products pay by configuration will generate a daily bill, and the system will deduct automatically. The account will give priority to deduct the coupon, or deduct the balance for insufficient coupon balance or no coupon.

2. Deduction Rules

(1) Normal coupon deduction cannot be conducted unless the coupon supports both the product line and the billing type.

(2) Under the same conditions, the system will give priority to deduct coupons with the lowest amount. For coupons with the same amount, those with the latest validity period will be firstly deducted.
