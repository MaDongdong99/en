### **Use of Pay-As-You-Go**

1. The Pay-As-You-Go products such as products pay by configuration will generate a daily bill, and the system will deduct automatically. The account will give priority to deduct the coupon, or deduct the balance for insufficient coupon balance or no coupon.

2. Deduction Rules

(1) Normal coupon deduction cannot be conducted unless the coupon supports both the product line and the billing type.

(2) Under the same condition, the system prefers to deduct the coupon with latest expiry date. If the expiration time is the same, the coupon with the minimum amount will be deducted first by the system.
