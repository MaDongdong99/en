# Application Scenarios
## Cross-cloud Backup
Data stored by users in the local data center, in combination with Cloud Disaster Recovery and basic services of JD Cloud, can be backed up or filed to JD Cloud in the fixed time/real time with local data, so as to realize safe, economic and easy-managed data protection.
## Cross-cloud Disaster Recovery
To avoid service unavailability due to availability zone level failure, a remote disaster recovery center can be built via Cloud Disaster Recovery, to improve service availability. Data of the disaster recovery center and the business center are synchronized via Cloud Disaster Recovery, to guarantee data consistency. When the business center fails, business traffic can be directly switched to the disaster recovery center, to recover service quickly.
## Database Disaster Recovery
A database is respectively deployed in two data centers of the city. Data in the database of the primary data center can be replicated and backed up to the database of the secondary data center in real time. When the database of the primary data center fails, businesses will be switched to the database of the secondary data center.
