# Benefits
## Low Overall Cost
There is no need to set up a disaster recovery center, requiring no data center operation and maintenance and having no hardware purchase cost; as the cloud mainly consumes stored resources, the computing resource demand is very low; and RPO/RTO grading can be made for different application demands and different network bandwidth, saving the cost.
## Continuous Data Protection
By monitoring changes of protected data, data are continuously replicated to a local or remote disaster recovery center located at any place to realize continuous data protection. Meanwhile, every data change is replicated to the data protection zone.
## RPO/RTO Grading
The step type RPO/RTO for applications of different levels can be customized according to enterprise demands; the key business type is based on disk type real-time data replication technology, thus being able to provide second level to minute level RPO/RTO; and the standard type is based on data timing backup capacity, thus being able to provide hour level RPO/RTO.
## Application Level Disaster Recovery and Data Level Disaster Recovery
High-efficiency disaster recovery replication and on-cloud recovery of application servers such as Windows and Linux are supported, realizing application level disaster recovery; or, real-time synchronization and fixed-time backup and JD Cloud Onboarding are only applicable for key application data, including SQL Server and MySQL and failover is made as per policies.
## Cross-platform/Independent to Hardware
Support any disaster recovery combination of physical machine and Virtual Machines (P2V, P2P, V2P and V2V), with extremely-low RPO and PTO. Support various systems of Virtual Machines.
## Simple Operation and Maintenance as well as Rapid Expansion
Provide unified management for on-cloud/off-cloud backup business, with computation, storage and network resources purchased by service, and no dedicated operation and maintenance by person is required; backup can be easily made so that users can focus on business management.
