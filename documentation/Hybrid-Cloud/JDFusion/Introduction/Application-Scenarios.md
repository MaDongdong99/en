# Application Scenarios
## Multi-cloud Resource Management
Large enterprises may be provided with cloud services by multiple cloud vendors; each cloud service has a mass of resources; the management is extremely complicated. JDFusion provides the enterprise with a unified cloud resource management platform, by which the unified management can be carried out for multiple cloud resources. It reduces influence of the different interfaces provided by cloud vendors, and allows enterprise users to access and manage the cloud services provided by different cloud vendors with the console and standard APIs.

## Cross-cloud Data Migration
JDFusion can improve the automatic extent of data migration, achieve automatic connection of data migration, and allow business application to carry out rapid deployment and verification on the new cloud relying on cross-cloud resource creation.

## Cross-cloud Data Disaster Recovery
JDFusion supports the database backup of self-built IDC, self-built database on cloud and other cloud environment, easily connects to the storage service on cloud vendors, more flexibly plans and deploys the seamless integration of its own storage resources, and helps users implement existing applications, basic architecture and data storage with JD Fusion, so as to rapidly build cloud backup. Data transmission supports SSL encryption to guarantee the data security.

## Cross-cloud Business Multi-active
JDFusion fully considers high efficiency, convenience, reliability and comprehensiveness, the four core enterprise pursuits. From infrastructure, PaaS, distributed application and other aspects, multi-active becomes a service, convoying the enterprise business, implementing cross-cloud multi-active and dynamic scaling of cross-cloud resources, and protecting the business from being impacted by the cloud vendors.
