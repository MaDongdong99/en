       <tr>
        <td>Region</td>
        <td>The cloud vendors' machine rooms are distributed in many worldwide locations, which are referred as the regions. Different regions are completely isolated from each other, ensuring maximum stability and fault tolerance among different regions.         </td>
        </tr> 
        <tr>
        <td>Availability Zone</td>
        <td>Availability Zone is a physical region where power, network, and other infrastructure are independent of each other. A region contains one or more availability zones, and multiple availability zones in the same region can be connected to each other.
        </td>
        </tr> 
        <tr>
        <td>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</td>
        <td>The user can customize a logically-isolated network space on JD Cloud. This VPC network space is fully controlled by users and supports customized network segmentation, routing policies, etc. Users can create and manage multiple cloud products in the VPC, such as virtual machines, and load balancer, and configure resources within the network to connect to the Internet.
        </td>
        </tr> 
        <tr>
        <td>Subnet</td>
        <td>A subnet is an IP address block within the IP address range of the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The subnet is under the VPC. After creating a VPC, users can add subnets under the VPC. IP address blocks of subnets under the same VPC cannot overlap, and IP address blocks of subnets under different VPCs can overlap.

         <tr>
        <td>Instance Type</td>
        <td>The instance type refers to resources assigned to each node of an instance type, including the CPU core, memory capacity, networking configuration, etc.
        </td>

         <tr>
        <td>CPU Core</td>
        <td>Refer to the computing power cap applicable to each instance node. One CPU has the computing power of 2.3GHz hyper-threading (Intel Xeon Series Hyper-Threading) at least.
        </td>

          <tr>
        <td>Memory</td>
        <td>Refer to the memory capacity assigned to each instance node.
