# Overview of Getting Started
## Setup Process
The setup process for the customers to use the Cloud Cabinet Service of JD Cloud & AI is as follows:

1. The pre-sale department needs to communicate with you to confirm the specific demands;

2. The pre-sale & products departments confirm the resources required according to your demand;

3. The sales department sign a contract with you and confirm the demand information;

4. After JD Cloud & AI records your cabinet information into the Cloud Cabinet Service background, you can start to use the Cabinet Service at JD Cloud & AI's Official Console [https://ccs-console.jdcloud.com/](https://ccs-console.jdcloud.com/). After Cloud Cabinet Service is enabled/disabled, JD Cloud will inform you via emails and SMS for convenience of checking at any time.

5. You can open the ticket that you require by the Console-Cloud Cabinet Service-Ticket Management Module, convenient and efficient.
