# Core Concepts

- Cloud Cabinet Service

    Provides high quality IDC resources for customers to achieve hosted service for their own devices. The Console displays the customer's cabinet, device, IP and bandwidth information.
  
- Colocation Center

    Colocation Center is a type of data center where device, space, and bandwidth are available for rental to customers. According to the data center standard of JD Cloud, IDC  resources in different locations are provided for customers. We use the concept of data center to describe the location of the cabinet you rent. Different data centers are completely isolated. You can choose the nearest location. At present, data center resources are available in cn-north, cn-east and cn-south.

- Hosted Device

    After customers rent the cabinets, they can have their own device hosted to the JD Cloud data center, including but not limited to servers, switches, routers, firewalls, etc.
  
- Hosted Cabinet
 
    JD Cloud provides cabinets of different specifications (cabinet space, rated current, etc.). Customers can choose suitable cabinets for themselves. At present, Cloud Cabinet Service supports the complete cabinet hosting but does not support bulk U hosting.
