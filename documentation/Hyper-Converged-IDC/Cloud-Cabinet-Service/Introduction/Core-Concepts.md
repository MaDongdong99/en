# Core Concepts
  
- Colocation Center

    Colocation Center is a type of data center where device, space, and bandwidth are available for rental to customers. According to the data center standard of JD Cloud & AI, IDC resources in different locations are provided for customers. We use the concept of data center to describe the location of the cabinet you rent. Different data centers are completely isolated. You can choose the nearest location. Now, the data center resources are only provided in North China, East China, South China and some of their surrounding cities.

- Hosted Device

    After customers rent the cabinets, they can have their own device hosted to the JD Cloud & AI data center, including but not limited to servers, switches, routers, firewalls, etc.
  
- Hosted Cabinet
 
    JD Cloud & AI provides cabinets of different specifications (cabinet space, rated current, etc.). Customers can choose suitable cabinets for themselves. At present, Cloud Cabinet Service supports the complete cabinet hosting but does not support bulk U hosting.  
  
- Bandwidth Service

    Relying on the quality IDC network resources provided by JD Cloud & AI, customers can select different bandwidth lines and access methods according to their own business demands. Through efficient management, real-time business monitoring, dynamic network maintenance, device interconnection between different manufacturers and other product benefits, customers can greatly increase network resource utilization rate, reduce management and maintenance expense and realize flexible, reliable and efficient network operation and maintenance.

- BGP Bandwidth

    Via the BGP routing protocol, interconnection with major operators, including Telecom, Unicom and Mobile is realized. Via route selection, the optimized quality can be realized and faster mutual access between customers and major operators including Telecom, Unicom, Mobile and CERNET is provided.

- Single Line Bandwidth

    By virtual of static interconnection with one, two or more than two major operators of Telecom, Unicom and Mobile, faster mutual access can be realized between customers and these operators.
