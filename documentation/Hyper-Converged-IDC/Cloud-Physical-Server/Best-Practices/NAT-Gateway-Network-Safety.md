# Network Security Scheme for NAT Gateway

## Overview
The NAT Gateway can allow the arrival of the inbound traffic of its relevant Cloud Physical Server (CPS for short) and allow the outbound traffic leaving from Cloud Physical Server by customizing the security policy. The NAT Gateway will (deny) all traffic by default. NAT is a set of security mechanism used for setting, maintaining and checking Internet communication of the Cloud Physical Server, providing a stateful firewall to the Cloud Physical Server (CPS), and specifying and remembering connection status established for sending or receiving information.

## Introduction to Application Scenario
Internet access by CPS of intranet only require that a Cloud Physical Server with one public network and one private IP, while the other Cloud Physical Servers only require one private IP. By using the server with public IP as the NAT Gateway, all Cloud Physical Servers can access the public network. The user can also allow the public network access by specific Cloud Physical Server according to the business demand.

Similarly, the CPS accessing intranet via the public network can access business application systems via the Intranet or realize remote management to CPS by using the server with the public IP as the NAT Gateway and mapping corresponding IP or port number.

With the NAT Gateway, the network architecture is simplified, the public IP amount is reduced and the network security of intranet CPS and business application system are enhanced.

## Configuration Scheme
The simulated IP information of configuration command is provided. Please purchase the IP information of the Cloud Physical Server for replacement.


**Note **: Please disable SSH login port 22 with care, as disabling port 22 will lead to inaccessibility from the external to the NAT Gateway and the Cloud Physical Server.

### Configuration Scheme for CPS Public Network Access of Intranet

#### Cloud Physical Server Modification

1. SSH logs in the internal Server ssh root@172.16.0.4 via the NAT Gateway (the password is the one manually set at the time of purchase)

2. Default IP Information [Figure 1.0] and Route Information [Figure 1.1]

<p align="center">Route Information [Figure 1.1]</p>

3. Modify the Cloud Physical Server to be the Private IP of NAT Gateway (such as 172.16.0.3):

vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0, add one entry of `GATEWAY=172.16.0.3`, save and exit wq, and restart the service to take effect the service network restart.

#### Configuration Policy of NAT Gateway System

1. Enable the route forwarding functions of the system:

Edit the vim vi /etc/sysctl.conf file, modify `net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1`; the configuration will take effect without restarting system for sysctl –p.

2. Add FORWARD rules

The default iptables policy does not allow the traffic forwarding, therefore we need to delete the default banning rules of forwarding; in `iptables -D FORWARD 1`, `1` refers to the first rules of the FORWARD rules. As there is only one default FORWARD rule by, it is required that only the first rule is deleted.

![默认forward转发规则图2.0](https://github.com/jdcloudcom/cn/blob/edit/image/Hyper-Converged-IDC/Cloud-Physical-Server/CPS030.png)

<p align="center">Default Forward Rules [Figure 2.0]</p>


`iptables -A FORWARD -s 172.16.0.0/16 -i eth0 -j ACCEPT`


It is allowed to forward the traffic from the intranet segment (172.16.0.0/16) and from the intranet network interface eth0.


`iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED  -j ACCEPT`


Forwarding of the traffic with established links is allowed and entrance of new request traffic from the Internet is not allowed.

<p align="center">Forward Rules [Figure 2.1]</p>

3. Configure SNAT (the internal CPS can access public network via the NAT Gateway):

```
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.16.0.0/16 -o eth1 -j SNAT --to-source 103.37.46.14
```

4. Save configuration

service iptables save

### Configuration Scheme of Public Network Access CPS

1. Add filter security rules:

Access to corresponding businesses is allowed, such as TCP, UDP, ICMP services of SSH 22, NTP 123 and http80.

```
Iptables -A INPUT -i eth1 -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i eth1 –p udp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i eth1 -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
```

2. 	Configure DNAT (the public network can access the Cloud Physical Server via the NAT Gateway)
Map the TCP 8888 port number to SSH 22 port of CPS.

```
Iptables –t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8888 -j DNAT --to-destination 172.16.0.4:22
```

3. Save configuration
