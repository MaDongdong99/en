# Set RAID Level

## Function Description

RAID means “Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks”.

The basic idea is that a large number of independent disks are combined into a disk group with huge capacity, and the addition effect of the data provided by the individual disks improves the performance of the entire disk system. Compared to a single hard disk, disk arrays have faster transfer rates, significantly increase the data throughput of the storage system, and provide fault tolerance function through data verification simultaneously. In a nutshell, the goal of RAID is to improve read/write performance and fault tolerance capability.

In addition, the disk arrays look like a separate hard disk or logical storage unit for the server.
