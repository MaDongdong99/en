# Renewal Procedure

## Renewal Rules
Renewal of monthly package: Expand the use duration of monthly package cloud physical server. The renewal time periods include 1 month ~ 9 moths, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years. If you operate to renew prior to the instance date due, the start time of the new order is expiration time of the original order; if you renew after resource date due, the start time of the new order is the date of renewal.
