**Select Server Configuration** 
For the introduction to configuration of Distributed Cloud Physical Server, please refer to [Specifications](../Introduction/Specifications.md).

**Billing** 
Two billing methods, monthly package and pay by configuration are supported. For detailed information related to billing, please refer to [Billing Rules](../Pricing/Billing-Rules.md).<br/>
- If you purchase an instance by monthly package which applies pay-in-advance, you need to pay all costs for the selected instance configured in the designated life cycle in a lump sum, so the account balance (cash reserve and available coupon) must be sufficient or you may select third-party payment when you make the payment.<br/>
- If you purchase an instance paid by configuration which applies pay-as-you-go, to avoid the failure of resource deduction due to insufficient account balance within the billing cycle and further affect the normal use of the instance, your account balance (cash reserve and available coupon) shall not be less than the consumption threshold when you enable an instance paid by configuration. Therefore, if you select this billing mode, you shall recharge your account with at least RMB 50 to ensure the creation of instance. And then you can estimate the overall cost and recharge it according to the daily cost and use duration of the selected instance configuration.
