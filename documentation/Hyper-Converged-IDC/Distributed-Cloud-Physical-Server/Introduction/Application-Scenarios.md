## Video Monitoring
As there are video monitoring demands in scenarios such as governments, security and business, there are numerous video traffics and the storage capacity demand is high, the direct JD Cloud Onboarding bandwidth cost is high and it is difficult to guarantee quality service. The Distributed Cloud Physical Server can enable nearby high-performance computing and high-performance storage server in the same city and same region, solve video traffic collection, storage and intelligent analysis and realize low-cost and high-quality intelligent monitoring and storage.
