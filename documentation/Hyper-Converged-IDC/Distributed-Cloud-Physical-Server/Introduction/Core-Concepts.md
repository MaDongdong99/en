# Core Concepts

Distributed physical computing resources on cloud, namely one Cloud Physical Server running in the edge node, also **Instance**.

Data center where the Distributed Cloud Physical Server is located, namely **Node and Operator**.

Scenario applicable to Distributed Cloud Physical Server, consisting of different CPUs, memories, storages and networks etc., namely **Instance Type Family**.

Private and public instance service addresses, i.e. **private IP and public IP addresses**.

Operation interface based on Web, i.e. **JD Cloud Console**.

## Concept Details

### Instance
Distributed physical computing resources on cloud, namely one Cloud Physical Server running in the edge node, also instance. Instance is a JD Cloud Distributed Cloud Physical Server purchased by a user. JD Cloud provides instances with different storage space, computing capability and storage redundancy to meet different requirements of user for instances under different business scenarios. When a user purchases one instance, he or she may obtain its complete control right, including startup, shutdown, reboot, etc.

### Node and Operator
We use Node and Operator to describe the location where the Distributed Cloud Physical Server is located, and you may purchase the Distributed Cloud Physical Server at a specific edge node and operator.

Node refers to edge node, namely region-city. Operator refers to Telecom, Unicom and Telecom.

Operator edge nodes opened for sale by the Distributed Cloud Physical Server are as below.
