# Core Concepts

Distributed physical computing resources on cloud, namely one Cloud Physical Server running in the edge node, also **Instance**.

Data center where the Distributed Cloud Physical Server is located, namely **Node and Operator**.

Scenario applicable to Distributed Cloud Physical Server, consisting of different CPUs, memories, storages and networks etc., namely **Instance Type Family**.

Private and public instance service addresses, i.e. **private IP and public IP addresses**.

Operation interface based on Web, i.e. **JD Cloud & AI Console**.

## Concept Details

### Instance
Distributed physical computing resources on cloud, namely one Cloud Physical Server running in the edge node, also instance. Instance is a JD Cloud & AI Distributed Cloud Physical Server purchased by a user. JD Cloud & AI provides instances with different storage space, computing capability and storage redundancy to meet different requirements of user for instances under different business scenarios. When a user purchases one instance, he or she may obtain its complete control right, including startup, shutdown, reboot, etc.

### Node and Operator
Node means different geological locations (region-city) of edge data center of JD Cloud & AI. Different nodes are absolutely isolated, providing services which are communicated via the public network.<br/>
Operator means Telecom, Unicom and Telecom.

Nodes opened for sale by the Distributed Cloud Physical Server are as below.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td >&nbsp;</td> 
        <td ><B>Node</B></td> 
		<td ><B>Operator</B></td>
		<td ><B>Open Status</B></td>		
    </tr>
    <tr>   
        <td rowspan="4"><B>In Mainland China</B></td>
		<td >East China-Taizhou</td>
		<td >Telecom 1</td>
		<td >Opened</td>
    </tr>
</table>
