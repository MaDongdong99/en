## Elastic IP

### Product Overview

Elastic IP is a static IP dedicated for dynamic cloud computing. Different from the traditional static IP, elastic IP can be associated with any Distributed Cloud Physical Server and you can associate it to A or B. When the Distributed Cloud Physical Server fails or the availability zone fails, you may remap the IP address to a healthy Distributed Cloud Physical Server, and then you can handle server issues while providing services. Elastic IP is called as "Edge Cloud Public IP". (Note: This server refers in particular to the "Distributed Cloud Physical Server")

### Use Restrictions

Please keep the following restrictions in mind when using the Elastic IP.

1. Now, JD Cloud & AI supports that at most 10 elastic IPs are applied for each account per node. If more quotas are required, please [Open Ticket](https://ticket.jdcloud.com/applyorder/submit) to increase quota.<br/>

2. Elastic IP may only be associated with operator resources in the same node (including Distributed Cloud Physical Server).<br/>

3. Elastic IP can be associated and disassociated with Distributed Cloud Physical Server.<br/>

4. One single Elastic IP can be associated/disassociated for several times in one day. If it is required to change the IP of the resource that has associated Elastic IP, the resource shall disassociate current IP before associating new IP.<br/>

5. Now, monthly package resources are not allowed to be deleted.<br/>

### Billing Overview

Elastic IP supports 2 billing methods, i.e., Monthly Package and Pay By Configuration, and 2 billing items, i.e., bandwidth and additional uplink bandwidth. Monthly package: Pay in advance by bandwidth configuration Pay by configuration: Bill per hour according to the bandwidth configuration

**Monthly Package Billing**

The monthly package is Pay-In-Advance type, with a one-time fee of one month, several months or many years. It is suitable for the scenario of pre-estimation of Elastic IP bandwidth demand, and the cost is cheaper than billing by configuration.

Detailed Description:
Costs for months or years are paid in advance, and current purchased time period supports 1 month~9 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years; costs are deducted at one time when creating the resources; for example: you have purchased the Telecom Elastic IP with 1M bandwidth and 1M additional uplink bandwidth for 1 month at 10:00:00 on August 2, 2017 at the monthly unit price of RMB 23, then you need to pay RMB 23=23* 1 and you could use this resource till 23:59:59 on September 2, 2017.

The resources of the monthly package do not support deletion before it expires. To guarantee your use rights, please confirm the business needs and then purchase.

The expiration time of monthly package billing order is 23:59:59 in the Nth natural month or natural year from the start time of the order; for example, if the start time of the order is from 15:00:00, January 1, 2016 and the duration is 1 month, the expiration time is 23:59:59, February 1, 2016.
