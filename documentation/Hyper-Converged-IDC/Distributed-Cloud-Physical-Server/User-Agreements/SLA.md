## 2. Service Level Indicator

### 2.1 Server Availability

Server availability means the ratio between the time that the server hardware plays its due function in the service cycle and the total service time.

**Server availability: not less than 99.9%

Unavailable means the status where the cloud physical server suffers a non-redundant hardware failure, which requires downtime for maintenance.

Available time computation = (Total available time of all servers)/(Total available time of all servers for the current month)

Suppose Party A purchases 100 sets cloud physical servers from Party B, i.e., the available time for the current month shall be 100*24*30*99.9%=71928, i.e. there are 100*24*30*(1- 99.9%) =72 hours unavailable time.
