# Application Scenarios

The following explains scenarios applicable to the Edge Physical Computing Service.

**Internet of Things (IoT)**

Internet of Things is the carrier for information of Internet and traditional telecommunication network etc., enabling the interconnected network for all ordinary objects able to exercising independent functions. As devices of Internet of Things require more agile connection and more efficient data processing, by deploying edge nodes near user sides, assists are provided to main data network to easily process user’s data, provide timely response and support intelligent computing by IoT devices.

**AI**

At present, most AI computations are supported by the Cloud data centers. Therefore, the network congestion is easily caused. If a high-performance computing platform is built by deploying edge nodes, data will be locally computed and environment awareness, human-machine interaction and decision control can be made in real time without networking.
