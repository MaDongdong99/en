# Product Overview
Photo Filters Matching Service is a practical function intelligently extending a single color matching scheme to multiple color matching results. Based on intelligent image recognition technology, image colors can be precisely recognized and replaced, achieving high availability, rapidly deriving diversified design styles so as to greatly expand application scope of images and effectively reduce human production cost.

## Benefits
### 1. 	Agility and Efficiency
Replace labor with machine working, and realize intelligent color recognition and greyscale calculation for design objects and rapidly output color matching results of different styles in batches, realizing accuracy, efficiency, convenience and ease of use.<br>
### 2.	Massive Schemes
Massive color schemes are derived. Through flexible combination of materials, the count of color filling results is incomparable by manual production.<br>
### 3.	High Availability
The preset color matching schemes have been calculated and optimized for several times, supporting pixel-level recognition and treatment for complex images and achieving artistic and reliable results.<br>

## Features
### 1. Color Matching and Extension of Image
Divide image areas from the pixel level and replace colors<br>
Transmission of any images in formats such as JPG, PNG and PSD by users is supported, colors in different areas of images can be intelligent recognized and original colors can be replaced with the new to generate brand new color matching result and output the results in the image form. One image to be recognized can be transmitted per calling and 4 different color matching results are generated.<br>

### 2. Color Pass
Specific colors can be filtered to the extent that results of this color will not be generated<br>
Users can upload the color to be filtered, then this color can be automatically omitted when the color matching result is producing, and other color matching results are produced. When it is used for producing results in batches, the color matching results before can be shielded.<br>

## Application Scenarios
### 1. Image Design
Rich color matching results can be derived from one image. Therefore, users can pick up the most appropriate color matching result based on contents transmitted by the images. A direct feeding of different color matching results is provided without manual color test, and with decision assistance, the best results are selected.<br>

### 2. Unified Color Matching for Design Scheme
The function of Photo Filters Matching perfectly divides color filling areas, supports customized image color matching, meets usersâ€™ demands for adjustment of specific image color in batches and unifies color matching of all images.<br>
