# Thing Model Introduction
The thing model is the data model in the digital world of a thing in the real world and describes the general functions of things of the same thing type. By defining the thing model, the physical devices and sensors in the real world can be managed by the IoT platform in a more convenient manner.

The thing model comprises one or more models. Each model defines a group of functions supported by the devices of this type and these functions are described from the property, event and function to finally form the basic data specifications for communication between applications and platforms as well as platforms and devices. The model can be divided into two categories, i.e. entity model and service model.

| Thing Model Conception  | Description |
| :-----| :----- |
|Property | It is a separate parameter to describe the device status and property, and can be divided into read-only, write-only and read-write types. For example, time, name, temperature, switch and other basic properties. |
|Function | It is a specific operation to be applied or invoked by the platform, comprising input parameter and output parameter. Compared to the property setting, the function can provide more complicated service logic. For example, execute a task. |
|Event  | Some messages triggered by conditions will be reported by the devices on its initiative. The event may carry event parameters and more information can be transmitted. |
|Model | The set comprising property, event and function represents a group of features of the device.|
|Entity Model|It is a function set of physical properties and awareness of a device entity, e.g. the model of a lamp.|
|Service Model|It is a function set of service types supported by the device application, e.g. connection proxy service model and OTA service model.|

#### Component Identification of Thing Model

According to the thing model specifications, the property, event, function, model and thing model are identified with an id, and the id value shall be organized in the format of urn (uniform resource name). The form is as follows:

id= urn:"{spec-namespace}":"{type-namespace}":"{object-name}":"{object-code}"


The following is the description of fields:

| Field           | Description                                                         |
| :------------  | :-----------------------------------------------------------|
| urn            | Fixed Field                                                     |
| spec-namespace | Specification name space, valid value: standard definition: jiot-spec-[version]; Customized: [user]-spec-[version]; |
| type-namespace | Type name space, valid value:   property[property];  function[function]; event[event]; model[model]; thing-model[device/thing model] |
| object-name    | Object name, valid value: The value under type-namespace shall be unique and shall be a name with explicit definition, e.g. property name, function name, event name, model name, thing type, etc. In different type-namespaces, the meaning of the value may be different. For example, the value under the thing model {thing-model} is thing type {thing-type}, representing that the thing model is a specific type of thing and the thing type can be generated by the platform. |
| object-code    | Object code, valid value: The value under the object-name space must be unique [and can be globally unique if implemented], and it is the unique and distinct code for object-name when there are different definitions; For example, when an object-name is current-temperature, the definition may have various value scopes, but the code is different. The code shall be automatically assigned by the system, with at least 8 characters combining upper-case letters, lines and numbers. |
