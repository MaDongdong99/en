# Application Scenarios

The applicable scenarios for IoT Edge are specified as follows.

## Device JD Cloud Onboarding
By IoT Intelligent Edge Computing, you can directly access various sensors and devices without Intelligent connection capability to IoT Hub service for management after connecting them to edge nodes. In the meanwhile, device data can be stored directly in edge nodes and JD Cloud OSS.

## Image Detection
By deploying image detection module on edge nodes, you can collect images with your local camera devices, detect and identify these images by using different AI training sets. Results and images of detection will be automatically saved in your OSS and can be reused for marking and AI training to meet your increasing developed business requirements.
