# Benefits

## Intelligence

Provide capacities such as local data processing, AI learning, deduction and identification and keep cloud calculation capacity down to the edge.

## Convenience

 Support multiple protocols to rapidly and conveniently access various terminal devices, sensors to IoT Core Service.

## Real Time

Local data are collected, processed and cleaned and reported back to the user in real time.

## Security

Safe transmission from edge to cloud and local encryption of data.

## Efficiency

Jobs of device access, control, data storage, analysis, processing, AI deduction, etc. can be done under offline status to avoid delay and job interruption caused by network for accelerating edge decision-making speed.

## Economy

A massive of jobs of data collection and processing is done locally, so as to reduce costs of cloud transmission, storage and computing.
