# Core Concepts

See the following for the concepts and their interpretations used in the IoT Edge help documentation for IoT Intelligent Edge Computing.

| Concept        | Interpretation                                                         |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Edge Node      | The intelligent terminal device has certain computing, processing, storage and device connection abilities, runs the edge system and provides local computing and AI deduction |
| Edge System    | The intelligent system deployed and running on edge node devices extends cloud computing power to local edge nodes and provides the running environment for the intelligent computing module, for executing intelligent computing on site. |
| Edge Application | A series of applications running on edge nodes and executing device connection, management, data collection, storage, intelligent analysis, deduction, decision making, etc. based on the edge business scenario and edge node ability. |
| Edge Computing | it refers to the distributed open platform (architecture) near to the network edge side of an object or data source and integrating networking, computing, storage and core application abilities, providing the edge intelligent service nearby, and meeting the key demands of industry digitalization in respect of swift connection, real-time business, data optimization, application intelligence, safety and privacy protection, etc. |
