# Product Overview

IoT Edge is the intelligent system deployed and running on edge node device, which extends cloud computing power to local to realize self-control for edge node. Users can obtain capabilities such as device access management, data nearby processing, AI deduction, etc. through edge computing nodes on site. IoT Edge must rely on and be used with IoT Core.

IoT Edge has the following characteristics:

- Connection and management of child devices on edge node by users and child device data report to IoT Core are supported.
- Management functions such as edge application one-click deployment, configuration, and deletion.
- Carry out real-time collection and processing, analysis, AI learning, deduction as well as identification of local data.
- Offline work is supported, accelerating edge decision-making.
- Safe transmission from edge to cloud and local encryption of data.
