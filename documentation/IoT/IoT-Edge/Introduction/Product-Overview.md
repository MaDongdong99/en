# Product Overview

IoT Edge is an intelligent system deployed and running on edge node devices, which extends cloud computing power to local edge nodes for executing intelligent computing on site. Users can obtain capabilities such as operation of AI deduction models, data nearby processing, device access management, etc. through the IOT edge computing nodes on the device deployment site.

IoT Edge for IoT Intelligent Edge Computing has the following characteristics:

- Support multiple protocols to rapidly and conveniently access various terminal devices and sensors to IoT Hub.
- Carry out real-time collection and processing, analysis, AI learning, deduction as well as identification of local data.
- Offline work is supported, accelerating edge decision-making.
- Safe transmission from edge to cloud and local encryption of data.
