# The computing result of the object detection application cannot be viewed

## Problem Description

I can’t see the computing resulting of the object detection application in my Object Storage Service?

## Troubleshooting
 
1. You need to firstly confirm that the Object Storage Service is normal, because the computing result should be uploaded to your Object Storage Service.

2. Please confirm that the Object Storage Service path you are accessing is the same as the path you specifies on the edge application page.

3. Please confirm that your object detection application has normally run, and the camera has normally enabled.

4. Please re-start the computing module, after the above-mentioned steps are completed.

5. For detail operation steps, please refer to [Practices for Peripheral Vision Detection](../Best-Practices/Object-Detect.md).

## Follow-up Processing

  If the issue still isn’t solved through the above-mentioned operation, please [Open ticket](https://ticket.jdcloud.com/myorder/form?cateId=166&questionId=238) or call the customer service staff 400-615-1212.
