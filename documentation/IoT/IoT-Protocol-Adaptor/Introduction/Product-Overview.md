# Product Overview


The IoT Protocol Adaptor Service converts the adaptor modules through the built-in non-standard device communication protocol to help users with JD Cloud Onboarding of the existing devices in a quick and low-cost manner. The service builds in JTT-808 (related to vehicle monitoring system of the Ministry of Communications) protocol support.

The IoT Hub Protocol Adaptor Service has features as below:

* Device Communication:
	* As the Hub Service device communication agent, it supports two-way communications of IoT devices, sending the up telemetry data of the device to Hub Service and receiving the device control command data sent by Hub Service.
* IoT Protocol Conversion:
	* The protocol conversion module supports users to implement customized protocol conversion by programming. It builds in JTT-808 (related to vehicle monitoring system of the Ministry of Communications) protocol support.
