# Billing Overview
## Charging Items

The IoT Hub Protocol Adaptor Service needs to be used together with the IoT Hub Service. During the Beta, you only need to pay for the IoT Hub Service and not for the IoT Hub Protocol Adaptor Service. After the subsequent product architecture is upgraded, the product charge mode will be adjusted in order to satisfy needs of customers with different oriented businesses.
