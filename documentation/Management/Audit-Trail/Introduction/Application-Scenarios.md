# Application Scenarios

## Security Analysis

If the user’s cloud account or resource has the security issues, logs recorded by Audit Trail can be used for analyzing causes for the user. For example, Audit Trail will record login operation of all accounts of the user, time of event, IP address and verification login by using multiple factors or not. Specific records of said items are available. With such records, the user can determine if the account has the security issue.
## Resource Change Trace

If the user’s resources have any abnormal changes, the user can find the causes with the assistance of the operation logs recorded by Audit Trail. For example, when you find out that instances of one Virtual Machine stop, the operation account and the time of enabling the stopping operation can be tracked via Audit Trail.
## Compliance Audit

If the user’s organization has many members and identities of these members are managed by the IAM service of JD Cloud, the user needs to get specific operation records of each member, to meet compliance audit demands for the organization of the user. Operation events recorded by Audit Trail can meet the compliance audit demands.
