# Audit Trail Overview

The Audit Trail is a service provided by JD Cloud, used for recording historic APIs calling records by the userâ€™s account and providing operation record search. Users can implement accurate tracking and restore user behavior audit by all operation records saved by Audit Trail. Audit Trail plays a very important role in security analysis, resource change trail and compliance review.

### Operating Principle
Audit Trail will be enabled when a JD Cloud account is created by the user. When the JD Cloud account of the user has any activity, such action will be recorded in the Audit Trail event. The user can easily and conveniently view events in the Audit Trail console.
Via the historic event records, the user can view and search any supported activity of the last 90 days of the JD Cloud account. You can search the retrieval or download the records to the local memory based on your requirements, so as to archive and analyze the activities and respond to JD Cloud resource changes of the user.
