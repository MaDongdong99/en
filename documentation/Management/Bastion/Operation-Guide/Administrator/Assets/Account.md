   - Name: account name, such as general root account, etc.

   - Login name: Linux/Windows account name, such as root

   - Password: If the password is provided by the user, the target machine can be automatically logged in via the Bastion

   - SSH private key: Please provide a corresponding private key when the resource is logged in via SSH Key Pair. After configuration, please preferentially use the SSH key to log in the SSH host resources.

     Bastion supports the RSA private key generated by ssh-keygen.  For example, you generate a public key and a private key in a Linux host by using the ssh-keygen command, where the public key is stored in the corresponding directory of the host, and the private key is locally exported. The private key information is entered/uploaded in this step
     
   - Encrypted Password: If the host can be logged in without a key pair as set, then leave the Encrypted Password empty

**Edit Account**

Operation Steps

1. Login Asset > Account Management page.

2. Click **Edit** in the account list. Modification to account, password, etc. is supported.
