## Application Scenarios

###  Site Access Performance Analysis
Access data from regions across the country to target addresses can be obtained by simulating users’ access behaviors with detection points of site monitoring. Then access quality of each region and each network can be learned and objective optimization can be made.

### Key Monitoring to Key Business
If quality of a specific site service has great influence to businesses, it needs to check if the service is normal or not from time to time. Detection tasks can be created via site monitoring under Cloud Detection and availability ratio alarm can be configured. Real-time availability ratio and delay data of site task can be viewed by logging in the Cloud Detection Console during routine inspection; Cloud Detection will immediately inform the person in charge in exception case and then users can take countermeasures in time.

### Real-time Monitoring to Intranet Service
If a specific service is deployed in VPC and its availability ratio and response time cannot be detected via site monitoring, users can install availability detection plug-ins under Virtual Machines in this VPC, create detection tasks via availability monitoring and configure availability ratio alarm or response time alarm. When monitoring indicators reach the alarm thresholds, a notification can be informed at the first time via SMS and email, protecting users’ businesses.
