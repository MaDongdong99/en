# Core Concepts

**Event Source**  

The event source refers the event mode defined by a user or specific event for calling targets and executing specific behaviors. For example, Monitoring sends an alarm and statuses of Virtual Machines are changed. 

**Destination**

The destination refers to the target to be called when the incurred event is matched with the event source set by the user. For example, restart Virtual Machines, execution functions, etc.
