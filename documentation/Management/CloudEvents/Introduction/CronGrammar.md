## 1. Description to Syntax Number Range
| Time Item | Minute | Hour | Day | Month | Week | Command Item |

| Number Range | 0-59 | 0-23 | 1-31 | 1-12 | 0-7 (0 and 7 both represent Sunday) | The user does not need to fill in this item |

## 2. Special Character and Description to Its Meaning
| Special Character | Description to Its Meaning |
|-|-|
| * (Asterisk) | Refer to the accepting willing at any time. Taking `0 18 * * *` for example, day, month and week are all represented with *, which means that designated commands will be executed at 18:00 in any day and any month. |
| , (Comma) | Refer to separate periods. For example, if the work is to be executed at 03:00 and 06:00, please use: `0 2,8 * * *`. There are still five time columns, but the second column is 2,8, which means both 2 and 8 are applicable |
| - (Minus) | Refer to a time range. For example, one work will be made within 10 minutes per hour from 06:00 to 08:00: `10 6-8 * * *`. Please be noted that the second column is changed to 6-8, which means 6, 7 and 8 are applicable |
| /n (Slash) | n refers to a number, i.e., separating once per n units. For example, if the operation is made once per five minutes, please use: `*/5 * * * *`, with * matched with /5. Or, you can use 0-59/10 to represent the same meaning |
