# Product Overview
Now, the cloud platform lacks the unified event management function. Users cannot detect events incurred by cloud products or give response corresponding to the events; users cannot report customized events and make event-oriented development.

Therefore, JD Cloud provides Cloud Event Service, via which users can view monitoring statistics incurred by events and set Event Subscription to some specific events. When there is an event, specific behavior will be triggered.
