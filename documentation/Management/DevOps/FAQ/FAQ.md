**Q**: How to compile different modules under the same git project?

**A**: 1) Creation of build.sh can be made only when the compiled products are under the directory of the same level (output/). Different module names received by build.sh are used as parameters.

 2) You need to create the control start and startup scripts under the directory bin/. Similarly, decision of start a module can be made by accepting and using different module name as parameters.
 
 3) For compilation of different modules, you need to specify the construction parameters in the process of compilation and construction, make the parameter judgment via build.sh and finally select compilation of different modules.

The examples are as follows:

Demand: Structures under the code repository is as follows: /A/m and /A/n are two modules for the same repository, A refers to directory (rather than maven project) and m  and n are two maven projects.

Solutions: Add build.sh under m and n, with compiling commands and methods of the project. Then, provide a build.sh in the root directory of code base, with approximate contents below:

cd $1 //Enter into the subdirectory  

source ./build.sh //Run compiling script of subdirectory

Then, create parameters with <Subdirectory> in the creation and construction page.

Demand: Packages for different environments will be compiled under the m project (for example, test and production). How to set the parameter dynamically?

Solution: The build under the root directory accepts two parameters, build.sh m test. Please enter the first folder in accordance with the first parameter, then create build.sh test and define the compilation command of the test parameter in build.
