# Create Service Tree Node

As the foundation of compilation construction, online release, intelligent monitoring and other function modules, you need to create Service Tree Node first and configure the relevant roles. The hierarchical relationship of the service tree is hierarchy-department-product line-system-application.

**Operation steps**

1. Click **Configuration Management** in the menu bar and enter the “Service Tree”. Please refer to the Service Tree on the left side.

The Service Tree template will be automatically created for the first use.


Next, please set the role for nodes of each level of the Service Tree (system, department, product line, system and application).

2. Click the node with the name of Service Tree, set the role and save.

The roles are shown as below:

Department: Person in charge, operation and maintenance personnel and developer

Product Line: Person in charge, operation and maintenance personnel and developer

System: Person in charge, operation and maintenance personnel, developer, tester and product specialist

Application: Person in charge, operation and maintenance personnel and developer
