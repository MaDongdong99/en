# Alarm Group&Duty Group

The alarm group and the duty group are both the recipients of alarm notifications, and the duty group is the on-duty personnel who receive the alarms. Generally, the duty group refers to a group of on-duty persons receiving the voice alarm, to reduce alarm influence to those which are not on duty. You can create the corresponding alarm group and duty group before configuring the alarm policy.

There are two types of alarm groups:

(1) Node Alarm Group:

​    •   After the service tree node is created, the monitoring system will automatically generate three alarm groups: System PM ($sys_pm$), system operation and maintenance ($sys_op$), and system testing ($sys_qa$), according to the roles added on the service tree nodes. The ($app_dev$) alarm group is generated on the application node,

​    •   In the alarm configuration, the usage rule of the node alarm group is to send an alarm to the corresponding node role alarm group when the NS triggers an alarm.

(2) Global Alarm Group:

​    •   The name of global alarm group is customized by the user;

​    •   For a global alarm group within the product line scope, any node is visible and available.
