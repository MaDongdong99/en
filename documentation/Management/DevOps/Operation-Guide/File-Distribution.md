# File Distribution

Click **Operation and Maintenance Tools** in the menu bar, enter “File Distribution”

Create new file distribution task

For the new file distribution task, the node corresponding to the left service tree should be selected first. After the creation of the file distribution task, it will be assigned to the service tree node. After selecting the service tree node, click **Create Task** to open the New Task page. In the page you can configure source files, set target path and target machines, multiple execution methods such as serial and parallel are supported by the file distribution, preposition and postposition commands can also be set.

Execute new file distribution task

Once the file distribution task is created, the operation can be performed through the task list. When executing, you can reset the source file, target directory, target machine, execution methods, execution account, etc. (the modification only affects the execution process at this time). When selecting the execution target machines, it provides two ways of direct "select the server" and "selection service tree" for the purpose of convenience.

After setting is completed, click Execute to open the detailed Execution page, and click **Single Machine** to see the detailed log output.
