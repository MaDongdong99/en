### Complete Hosted Directory Service

If you donâ€™t want to build up or maintain the enterprise directory locally, you can create the active directory of the enterprise on the cloud. After creation succeeded, you can just perform trust configuration on enterprise director and directory services on cloud, which completely saves the maintenance of the enterprise directory, as well as expansion and contraction work of the directory but implementing completely same functions.

### Expand Your Local AD to JD Cloud

If you have an existing AD infrastructure and use it when you migrate AD awareness work load to JD Cloud, JD Cloud hosted directory service is helpful. You can use AD trust to connect JD Cloud directory service to your current AD. It means that your users can use local AD credentials to access AD awareness applications and JD Cloud applications, without synchronizing users, groups or passwords.
