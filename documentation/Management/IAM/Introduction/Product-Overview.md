# IAM Overview

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a user identity management and resource access control service provided by JD Cloud. User can use IAM to create, manage sub-user and control the operation permission of JD Cloud resources for them. The primary account can use IAM to authorize resources in the management account to others without sharing account password or access secret key and assign minimum permissions for the users as required to reduce the security risks of enterprise information.

* Manage sub-users and control their access permissions – you can create sub-user in IAM and assign required console access password or access secret key separately for sub-users to access JD Cloud resources and services. You can set whether to enable Virtual MFA Verification and conduct Virtual MFA Verification when executing sensitive operations according to the security level of the sub-user. You can control specific operation permissions on specific resources for sub-users by means of using system policies or create customized policies.
* Manage IAM roles and their permissions – you can create roles and manage permissions in IAM for the convenience of controlling to which operations that the sub-user or service playing the role can execute. You can define which sub-user to play the role and you can also use service roles or service relevant roles to designate relevant service to play the role, manage and operate other resources of JD Cloud on behalf of you.
