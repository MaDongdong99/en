# What is a policy

Authorization policy refers to JSON document with one or multiple permissions defined, developing policies shall follow the JSON syntax specification. By granting policies to the sub-users, groups, roles to control the access permissions of JD Cloud resources for the sub-users, groups and roles. In which, the access permission owned by the sub-user are the set of authorization policies added to the sub-user and the group it belongs to.

IAM supports two types of policies: system policies preset by JD Cloud and customized policies managed by users themselves.

- The system policies preset by JD Cloud when accessing product line, which are not allowed to be modified by users.
- As for customized policies managed by users themselves, users can create policies for specific action to specific resource by means of customized policy. You can also add restricted conditions to restrict source IP, specific access time, Virtual MFA Verification, etc. Users can edit this kind of policies by themselves or delete customized policies.

> You may find that there suddenly adds some policy names that contain “-v3” in the policy list. It is the policy automatically created by the system for you when the product line is connected to the IAM, the policy (Policy) syntax changes after switching from v2 version to v3 version, with the purpose to make all actions in the policy created previously by you compatible and effective. For example, when you need to grant JD Cloud administrator permissions to all user types of IAM, you need to grant both JDCloudAdmin and JDCloudAdmin-new policy, and when you grant JD Cloud read-only permission, you need to grant both JDCloudRead and JDCloudRead-new policy. This action will continue until all product lines supporting v2 switch to v3 version.
