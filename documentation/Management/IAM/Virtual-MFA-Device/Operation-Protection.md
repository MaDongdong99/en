# Overview
Operation protection means that when you are performing sensitive operations, you are required to perform identity authentication before the final execution of the operation, to prevent the false deletion and misoperation of resources to the greatest extent. Currently, the separate setting of primary accounts and subaccounts is available, and three identity authentication methods are provided: MFA verification, SMS verification, and Email verification.
