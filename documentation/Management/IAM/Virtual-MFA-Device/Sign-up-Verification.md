# Login Verification

Login protection means that when you associate to virtual MFA equipment, in addition to entering the user name and password, you need to enter the dynamic verification code generated by the virtual MFA equipment for secondary verification when you log in. In this way, even if the user name and password are lost, others will not be able to log in your account, which will ensure the security of your account to the utmost extent.
