# Multi-Factor Verification

After the MFA verification is enabled, when you log in, in addition to entering user name and password, you need to enter the dynamic security code generated by the virtual MFA device for secondary verification. In this way, even if the user name and password are lost, others will not be able to log in your account, which will ensure the security of your account to the utmost extent.

JD Cloud provides two MFA verification methods for login with an account.

1. Verification via scanning. You can open JD Cloud APP and use "Scan" or "My - MFA Verification- Scan Now" to conduct verification via scanning.

2. Manually enter verification code. You can open JD Cloud APP and click "My - MFA Verification" in turn to view the MFA verification code for corresponding account and then enter manually the six-digital security code.

## Exemption from MFA Verification within 7 days
To keep your account safe while improving the login experience, JD Cloud provides you with the option of "Trusting the current device and login without MFA verification within 7 days" in the step of MFA verification; and you can decide at the MFA verification page whether to enable this function or not.

If you choose to enable it and this MFA verification is passed, you do not need to do MFA verification any more when you log in your account on the current device for 7 days thereafter.
