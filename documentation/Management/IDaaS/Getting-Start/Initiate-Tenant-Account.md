## Use Enterprise Portal

The Identity Pass beta’s enterprise portal is independent from JD Cloud & AI's console. You can view the enterprise portal URL on the "Enterprise Settings" Page. Every enterprise has an independent portal URL. Please share this address to your users.

### Administrator Logs in Portal

The administrator can log in the portal by two ways:
* Log in the enterprise portal of the Identity Pass beta through JD Cloud & AI's console "Management - Identity Pass beta"
* Access enterprise portal URL, log in the enterprise portal login page, and select **Administrator Account Login

After the administrator logs in, he will enter the enterprise portal management view.

### User Logs in Portal

User accounts are created by the administrator. Users can access the enterprise portal URL, and enter the account and password of the Identity Pass beta for login. If the user has any problem during login, he can obtain support from the "Enterprise Contact Information" set by the administrator on the bottom of the login page.

After logging in, the user will enter My Application view. "My Application" is the application list authorized by the user. If the user hasn't obtained the application authorization, there will be no application displayed.
