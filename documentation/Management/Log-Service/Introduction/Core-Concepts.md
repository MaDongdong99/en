# Core Concepts

### Log Subject  

The log subject is the unit of log collection and storage. It is convenient for users to store the same type of logs generated by an application program. 

### Log Collection

A log collection is a unit of log subject management and is used to save various log subjects generated by different application programs under a service.  

**Examples**

A user has a service A to be applied to two applications, APP1 and APP2. APP1 is deployed at VM1 and VM2; APP2 is deployed at VM3 and VM4. APP1 generates two types of logs, LogA and LogB; APP2 generates two types of logs, Log1 and Log2.

The user can create a log set for service A, and then create four log topics of Topic_1, Topic_2, Topic_3, and Topic_4 under the log set, for collecting four different types of logs, LogA, LogB, Log1 and Log2 respectively. Consequently the specific types of log settings can be dumped and monitored.

### Log Source Setting

The log source setting refers to collecting log-related configuration information. The log source shall be specified, and the cloud product log and the userâ€™s business application log can be used as the log source.  

### Full Text Retrieval

The contents of the log do not distinguish between key and value, as long as the retrieval conditions are met.  

### Key Value Retrieval 

The contents of the log distinguish between key and value, and can quickly and accurately query the value of a specific Key.

### Log Dump

Log data is stored into the object storage service OSS according to the dumping rules set, and log files shall be downloaded in the object storage service bucket where it is dumped into for auditing, off-line analysis, and so on.

### Log Monitoring

Set log filter conditions for logs with monitoring demands. Set monitoring tasks for keywords or specified fields in log data which meet the filter conditions to view the monitoring graph and set alarm rules.
