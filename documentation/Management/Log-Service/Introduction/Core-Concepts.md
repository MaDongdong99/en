# Core Concepts

### 1. Log Subject  

The log subject is the unit of log collection and storage. It is convenient for users to store the same type of logs generated by an application program. 

### 2. Log Collection

A log collection is a unit of log subject management and is used to save various log subjects generated by different application programs under a service.  

**Examples**

A user has a service A to be applied to two applications, APP1 and APP2. APP1 is deployed at VM1 and VM2; APP2 is deployed at VM3 and VM4. APP1 generates two types of logs, LogA and LogB; APP2 generates two types of logs, Log1 and Log2.

The user can create a log set for service A, and then create four log topics of Topic_1, Topic_2, Topic_3, and Topic_4 under the log set, for collecting four different types of logs, LogA, LogB, Log1 and Log2 respectively. Consequently the specific types of log settings can be dumped and monitored.

### 3. Log Source Setting

The log source setting refers to collecting log-related configuration information. The log source shall be specified, and the cloud product log and the userâ€™s business application log can be used as the log source.  

Cloud product log source means that the logs are from cloud products. After the user purchases any cloud product at the Console, the cloud product will provide a log by default for being checked by the user. The user is not required to customize any field and format for the cloud product log or install a log collection agent as the log can be reported or collected at the backend of JD Cloud & AI. The user only needs to create a log configuration corresponding to the cloud product log type.

Business application logs refer to the logs generated from business applications deployed on JD Cloud & AI by the user. The content and format are customized by the user. The user is only required to select the Virtual Machines to be collected in log source settings, rather than manually install any log collection agent. The log collection agent will be automatically installed. It supports one-line and multi-line business application logs as log sources. Business application log supports being delivered to multiple types of destinations. By default, it is collected to the log topic in Log Service. Besides, the log can be delivered to cloud ES or cloud Kafka of the Console, or to the self-created ES or self-created Kafka.

### 4. Full Text Retrieval

Full-text search, i.e., the keywords search. The contents of the log do not distinguish between key and value, as long as the retrieval conditions are met.  

### 5. Key Value Retrieval 

Key value search, i.e., to search the key-value pair of the log content. The content in the log distinguishes key and value. It can be quickly and accurately queried in terms of the value of a specific Key. To search those with status code exceeding 300, you can select the KEY of the status code in quick search, such as statusCode. Select **>** for operator and enter 300 for the VALUE, then click **search** button to search out the eligible logs; You can also enter **statusCode > 300** in advanced search, then click **search** button to search out the eligible logs.

### 6. Log Dump

After the billing of the Log Service, it will be charged for the log data stored by the user in the Log Service. It will increase the user's storage cost if being stored in the Log Service for a long time; Besides, for some users, the log analysis function provided by the Log Service may not meet the requirements, so there is a need for offline analysis. Therefore, the Log Service supports the user to dump the log data to OSS, which supports multiple formats and compressed dump, so as to reduce the user's costs. Log data is stored into the object storage service OSS according to the dumping rules set, and log files shall be downloaded in the object storage service bucket where it is dumped into for auditing, off-line analysis, and so on.

### 7. Log Monitoring

In the operation and maintenance of an enterprise, the last thing one wants to see is that when there are business problems, such problems are not found in time; and the failure to grasp the operation of the business in real time. Therefore, in order to facilitate the user to understand the business operation in a timely manner and find problems quickly to reduce losses, log monitoring function is provided by the Log Service. The user can set screening conditions for logs with monitoring requirements, and set monitoring for keywords or specified field in log data that meet the screening conditions. It can view the monitoring diagrams and set alarm rules.
