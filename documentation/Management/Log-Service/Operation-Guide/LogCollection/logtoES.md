## Deliver log data to JCS for Elasticsearch

Support delivery of business application to JCS for Elasticsearch and the Elasticsearch self-established by user.

**The cloud ES selected by user is required to be in the same VPC network with the selected Virtual Machine for log collection.**

### Operation Process

1. During the creation of the log configuration for business application, the advanced configuration and the designated destination for delivery shall be enabled, and Kafka shall be selected as the type of delivery destination.

2. Users shall select the cloud ES instance in certain region based on their needs or choose to establish ES by themselves. If users select the cloud ES, the access domain of the ES will be acquired by default; if users choose to establish ES by themselves, they need to fill out the access domain of the corresponding self-established ES.

3. After the index prefix is filled out, the index will be generated by day, e.g. jdcloud-YYMMDD, in which the YYDDMM represents the year, month and day; if the index prefix is not filled out by users, jdcloud will be the prefix by default.

4. Upon configuration, the reported log data can be checked at the cloud ES or self-established ES.
