## Log Monitoring Configuration Case - Business Application Log Monitoring

The section specifies how to complete configuration of one log monitoring via a true case. It aims to describe the complete configuration process, making users easily understand log field monitoring function.

### I. Monitoring Configuration Target:

1. Conduct field monitoring for a game payment log deployed on the JD Cloud server by the user, so as to know the userâ€™s payment situation.

2. Count of all orders whose payment failed shall be counted per minute. If there are 50 orders whose payment failed in a minute, i.e., the payment system is abnormal, the alarm notification shall be set to inform the related person, Jason. If paymentStatus=failed appears in the log, it means that the payment failed.

### II. Monitoring Scheme Setting

The setting scheme for achieving the above monitoring configuration target is as shown below:

1. Select the log set (gameLog) and log subject (paymentLog) of the business application log, click monitoring configuration behind the paymentLog log subject and enter the monitoring configuration page.

{"paymentStatus":"succeed"}
{"paymentStatus": "failed"}
{"paymentStatus":"succeed"}
{"paymentStatus": "failed"}
{"paymentStatus":"succeed"}
```
7. Click **Test** and then you can see the indication in the test data result: Seen from 6 data of the sample logs, the original log text is 3count. Log data in the sample, meeting the requirements, are displayed in the result list. When the expectation is reached, click **OK** and complete configuration.
