# Single Line Text
## Overview
A single line text log refers to a log form where a single log only comprises one line of log data. Each log adopts a line break as the end mark. When single line logs are collected by Log Service, such single line logs will be stored as contents with content keys and log values. Log contents will not be subject to key-value extraction anymore. Log time refers to the collection time.
