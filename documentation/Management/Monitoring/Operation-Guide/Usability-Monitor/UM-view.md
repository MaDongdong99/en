## View the monitoring diagram.
You can view the response time and availability of the detection target by using monitoring graph.

**Response time**refers to the time from the initiation of the detection to the receipt of the result of the request. If there is a redirection in the process of the detection, the value shall contain the redirected time.

The average response time of all detection sources to the detection address is shown in the monitoring chart.


**Available rate ** The available rate = The Number of the detection results that the status codes of the detection points are less than 400 during the detection period / the total number of the detection results * 100.

The average available rate of all detection sources to the detection address is shown in the monitoring chart.
