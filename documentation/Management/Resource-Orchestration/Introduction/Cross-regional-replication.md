# Application Scenarios

## Multiplex of Cross-region Template

　　For the purpose of increasing service availability and disaster tolerance capacity, most services will adopt the multi-region deployment mode generally. Via the Resource Orchestration, such mode can help the user set up an orchestration template by abstracting and modeling modules, topologies and configuration relations in the same region. While deploying resources in another region, the created template file can be conveniently and rapidly used for one-key deployment.
