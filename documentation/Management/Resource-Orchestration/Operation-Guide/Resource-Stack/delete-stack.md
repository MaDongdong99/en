## Precautions

- Deleting a resource stack deletes the resources under the resource stack at the same time. If you want to keep some resources in the stack, you should define the deletion policy on your own in the template.

  Deletion Policy

  In the template, set the DeletionPolicy attribute to declare to retain a resource when the resource stack is deleted. The optional values are Delete and Retain.

  For example, set to retain vm instance when the resource stack is deleted. It can be declared according to the following code snippet:
     
     ```
      "Resources" : {
        "MyInstance" : {
          "Type" : "JDCLOUD::VM::Instance",
          "Properties" : {
            "ImageId" : "img-wcewkxc5c1"
          },
          "DeletionPolicy" : "Retain"
        }
      }
      
     ```
