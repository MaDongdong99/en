# Application Scenario

## Application Scenarios

### In-batch Resource Management
After setting different "tag keys" and "tag values" for resources according to the actual application scenario and ownership as well as other different dimensions for the resources, the user can filter resources according to tags of different dimensions in the resource list of the product line Console to achieve classified filtering of resources.

### Authorize resources based on tags
Through Identity and Access Management, set policies based on tags, to achieve the permission control accurate to resource granularity. For the specific operation guide, see Identity and Access Management.
