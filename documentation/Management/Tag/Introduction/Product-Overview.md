#Product Overview

------

Tag is the tool for JD Cloud’s users to manage their own resource instances. You can categorize the resources by associate tags for resources, thus you can manage your various types of resources in JD Cloud more effectively.
Each tag is composed of a “key” and a “value”, for example: "Using Department: Basic R&D Department”. At here, the “Using Department” is the “key” of this tag and the “Basic R&D Department” is the value of this “key”.
Each resource can associate 10 tags with different key.
The tag itself has no effect on the instance and it cannot be created independently without resource instance. When the last resource instance associated by a tag is deleted, this tag will also be deleted.
Currently, only the operation of associate and disassociate the tag by console is supported. You can associate tag for resource after the resource is created.

Currently, the sources supported by JD Cloud’s tag management include the types as follows:

 - Virtual Machine
 - Cloud Disk Service
 - SQL Server Database

There will be a follow-up increase of resources of the types that support to associate tags
