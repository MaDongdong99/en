## Search

In the upper right search bar, you can search the tags according to the “Tag Key” or ”Tag Value”, in order to find the tag keys or values you are seeking, as well as the resources they are associated to.

The search supports fuzzy searches for tag keys and values. You can enter only part content of the tag keys or values to get all the results that contain such content.
