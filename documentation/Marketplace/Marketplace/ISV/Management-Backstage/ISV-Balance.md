# Service provider settlement
 

The Marketplace will automatically generate a statement based on the settlement interval selected by the service provider when it moves in.

Semimonthly: a statement is generated at the 16th of each month, and the end of the month which is the first day of the following month.

The service provider can confirm the statement at any time after the statement is generated.

 

Service provider can log in service provider backend to confirm the statement.

The specific operation is to enter the service provider backend https://i-market.jdcloud.com/, select settlement management --- settlement system---the settlement status is filtered as: To be confirmed by merchants.

After confirmed by the merchant, it will be transferred to the Marketplace. And after the two-level review of the Marketplace and JD Cloud Finance, the financial department will transfer the settlement payment to the bank account confirmed when the service provider moves in.
