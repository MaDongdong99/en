Q: How to change the supply price without changing the price type?

A: The service provider can select the left menu in the service release platform, charge management-charge item list, select the service name to be modified, and directly modify the supply price.



Q: First time to release the service, a lot of places were set incorrectly, and the rereleased display name was occupied, how to deal with it?

A: Submit the application to be removed from the Marketplace operation and modify the service name to save. Then the service provider can rerelease a new service.
