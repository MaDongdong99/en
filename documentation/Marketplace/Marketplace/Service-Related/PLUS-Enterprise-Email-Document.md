If the email is received by the client, the user password needs to be verified again for viewing the email, ensuring that the confidential email can only be read by the recipient. At the same time, the recipient can only read and reply the self-destructive email, and forwarding, copying and printing the main text of the email are not allowed. After the email is destroyed, the recipient will not be able to see the email;

You can click the snapshot button in the “Multimedia” editing on the writing page to capture the image you need in three ways: Full screen, area and window.

Note: You can operate through IE browser; Firefox/Chrome/Safari browsers do not support the operation currently.

1.10.4 Can I send an email of the same size as the attachment limit?

In fact, sending an email with attachments is like sending a parcel; the package of the parcel is also included in the total weight of the parcel except the item in the parcel itself. The so-called attachment limit is to limit the total size of the three: The attachment, the content of the email and the transmission code added by the system (the code is a must to ensure secure transmission). The attachment is like the item in the parcel, and the email content and the transmission code are the package of the parcel. Namely, it can only be sent when the total size does not exceed the limit. So, if you send an attachment of the same size as the attachment limit, there are two possibilities:

1) In most cases, it cannot be sent out because the actual size of the attachment is indeed the same as the size of the attachment.

2) In a few cases, it can be sent out because the actual size of the attachment is not as large as the attribute of the attachment shows.

1.10.5 How long does it take for the recipient to receive my email?

You can Click **Sending Query” of User Self-service Query in the Webmail interface to check it. If the recipient is not a user of the site, then you can only check if the email has been delivered to his mailbox; if the recipient is a user of the site, then you can also check if he has read the email.

If the recipient still cannot receive the email after a long time, please try to send it again or contact the customer service center.

1.10.6 How many people can an email be sent to at the same time?

The recipients' email addresses can be distributed in the “To", “Cc" and “Bcc" addresses. For up to how many addresses can an email be sent to at the same time by default, please consult the mailbox administrator's specific settings. If the maximum sending limit number is exceeded, please send it in batches.

1.10.7 Email addresses of what formats can’t I send emails to?

Jdcloud mailing system currently does not support sending emails to email addresses with “／” and Chinese characters in the email username. If you send an email to these email addresses, the system will return the email.

1.10.8 Can my mailbox exchange emails with other mailboxes in the world?

Yes, as long as the recipient's mailbox is working properly and your email address is not on his rejection list, then you can exchange emails normally with his mailbox.

1.10.9 How can I guarantee that the emails I sent can be read by the recipient normally?

Users are recommended to write an email encoded with Simplified Chinese GB2312/GBK/Big5/UTF8; if the browser uses other encoding methods, it may cause email gibberish.

Other Methods:

1) Save the email content as a Word or text file, compress it with a compression tool such as Winzip, and send it as an attachment;

2) Save the email content as a picture with tools such as Photoshop and send it as an attachment.

Yes, if you want to send multiple attachments, just click **Add Attachment** multiple times.

·       Generally, Server A in the last Receive sentence is the address of the sender, and Server B is the sending server it uses, which is the origin of the email. While Server B in the first Receive sentence is the email receiving server of yourself. The contents added to the headers by various servers are different; sometimes you cannot find any IP Address or domain name in a Receive sentence; under such situation, you can just ignore it and keep searching on.

The file transfer station can help you to transfer files among multiple computers, such as your home-use computer and working computer; at the same time, it can send super-large attachments to solve the problem of traditional email attachment size limit. You can also check the downloading records in the file transfer station to strengthen file management.

1.20.4 What is a super-large attachment and what is the difference from an ordinary attachment?

As we know, an ordinary “Email Attachment” is 20M or 30M generally in size (subject to the setting by the administrator) and we still worry that if the mailbox of the other party can receive such a large attachment. Now, if your mailbox has opened the file transfer station, the large attachment of your mailbox can reach 1G (subject to the setting by the administrator), and you can send it to any email address. The recipient receives only the download link to large file, which is not subject to the capacity of the mailbox.

Note: You can operate through IE browser; Firefox/Chrome/Safari browsers do not support the operation currently.

The upload control can support resuming from break point and display upload progress, and support multiple files upload at the same time, to ensure the speed and stability of upload.

1.20.6 Can the other party receive and successfully download the super-large attachment?

What the recipient actually receive is a file download link with time limit, so it has nothing to do with how much attachment the recipient's mailbox supports. The other party only needs to download the file just according to the address in the email. If the super-large attachment you send is out of the validity period, or the number of downloads exceeds the limit, or you have deleted it, then the other party cannot download such super-large attachment.

Besides, you can also check whether the other party has successfully downloaded your large file through “Query” function in the file transfer station.

     You can use these user name and password to log in Webmail and all management interfaces. If it fails to log in, please check whether these user name and password are correct.


2. If you find that the management interface cannot be modified, for example, the permission is insufficient; you can use the userutil system tools to modify it, and please refer to the Use Manual for System Tools.


3. If all these methods above fail, please contact mailing system customer service personnel.




2.1.2      Why can‘t it send emails?

Here are some of the possible reasons:

1.Improper DNS setting causes failure to send emails outside. It is quite common; please check if the DNS server is set correctly and whether the DNS server is valid;


2) Caused by network fault or firewall. Please check if the connection to external site machine is normal by using ping command in the email server;


3) The other party suffers mailing system failure. Please check if the SMTP port (i.e.25 port) of the external site email server is normal by using telent command in the email server;


4) Human error. This type of error is easily overlooked. Please carefully check is the recipient's email address is correct and try troubleshooting by selecting another recipient;


5) The client software configuration is incorrect. If you are sending emails through a software such as Outlook and Foxmail, please check the server address, user name, password, etc. in these client software settings for troubleshooting, and make sure that you have selected “My Server Needs Verification”;


6) Other reasons. If there is no problem with the above checks, please contact the mailing system customer service personnel.


7. The user sends spams and there are many emails accumulated, and the inode of the disk is full as a result of that. (Error information is: Internal Server      Error)


8. When sending an email, if there is an extra blank space at the end of the address of the “Recipient” (The blank space entered in English will be ignored by the system, and the blank space entered in Chinese will be considered as part of the address), the other party will not receive the email, but the notification of successful sending will be given by the system, and the email is not bounced, either.


9). In Outlook, if the sender’s address filled in is not the email address of the user, emails may not be sent out. (Error information is: 553      You are not authorized to send mail, authentication is required). Please set that the sender's address is allowed to be inconsistent with the actual user's email address. Under the anti-spam management interface, Advanced Settings - Global Settings - Advanced Configuration - “The mail from sender must be consistent with the auth verified user”, which is modified as “No”.




2.1.3      Why can‘t it receive emails?

Here are some of the possible reasons:

1. You do not have the public network address and the external mailing system cannot connect to your server;


2. The SMTP port (i.e. 25 port) of your server refuses external access;


3. Whether the domain name of the mailing system has been registered; whether the domain name and the email exchange record (i.e., MX record) for this domain name have DNS resolution; whether MX has been pointed to the machine address of the server where the mailing system is located. You can contact the domain name service provider of the mailing system and ask them to assist you in setting DNS and MX records. Technical information about domain name and MX records, you can refer to relevant books or searching related web pages through search engines.


4. Network fault or blocked by the firewall. Please try to check the SMTP port (i.e. 25 port) of your mailing system using telenet command in an Internet environment;


5. The other party suffers email server failure. If you can receive emails from other sites, but fail to receive emails from certain site, it is probably that the email server of the site suffers failure.


6. The other party filled in your email address wrongly. We did find examples of incorrect filling, for example, adding extra blank space in Chinese. If necessary, you may ask the sender to provide the bounced email back to the mailing system customer service personnel for troubleshooting;


7. Trigger the local rules. If you can make sure it is not a spam or viral mail, you may ask the sender to save the email as a compressed file and send it again. If such fails again, please ask the sender to provide the bounced email back to the mailing system customer service personnel for troubleshooting;


8. Misunderstanding. You set up automatic forwarding without saving locally. In that case, the email will not be saved in your mailbox. Please check your automatic forwarding setting; whether you receive emails by using client software POP without reserving backup. In that case, the email will not be saved in your mailbox, either.


9. Other reasons. If there is no problem with the above checks, please contact the mailing system customer service personnel.


10. The mail sent by the sender is very large and it is a compressed file; the recipient opens the anti-virus function, when scanning, the compressed the file will take more time; if the default anti-virus time-out is shorter, it will not receive the mail during time-out period. Time-out period needs to be modified.


11. The user sets automatic forwarding, but does not save the email locally.


12. It exceeds the maxrcpt quantity limit, and a lot of people cannot receive the mass email.


13. Ns fails to resolve the domain name. If the server dns is modified, it shall restart the deliveragent to take effect; the methods are as follows: /home/coremail/bin/coremail      restart deliveragent


14. The email is bounced, since there are too many “Similar” emails. If an anti-spam system is installed, these values can be set; it can also set whether to filter internal emails. (At the anti-spam management interface - Advanced Settings - Global Settings - Advanced Configuration - Fingerprint Counter Filter Threshold Setting.)


15. Its score is too high judged by the intelligent filtering.


16. It is bounced by the rules set by the user.


17. It is bounced by keyword rules set by the system.


18. It is bounced by the Blacklist set by the system.




2.1.4      Why can’t it pop emails down from the server?

Here are some of the possible reasons:

1. The client software configuration is incorrect. Please check whether the server address, user name and password are set correctly by the client software you use;


2. Network fault or blocked by the firewall. Please try to check whether the POP3 port (i.e., 110 port) of the server can be connected by using telenet command on the machine where the user is;


3. Other reasons. If there is no problem with the above checks, please contact the mailing system customer service personnel.




2.1.5      What if login error of Webmail?

Here are some of the possible reasons:

1. Password to the user name is wrong and it gives a notification that “Verification failed, please carefully check the user name and password you enter” on the Webmail page


2. Clicking on any action after login has an error. Please check the notification in the error information carefully. If “FS_code” appears, it means that a certain service to the system is abnormal. It needs to restart the corresponding service module to enable the system back to normal. Steps for restarting is:


o   Access to command console (Run cmd command under Windows)

o   Access to [Installation Directory/bin] directory

o   Run command coremail restart servername


Code

2.1.7      Why the system receives so many spams?

Here are some of the possible reasons:

1. The user made the email address known to the public. If so, it will be easily captured by the spam sender, so it is easier to become the object of sending spam.


2. The anti-spam mailing system used by the system is not the latest version. The mailing system has been developing new filtering technologies to cope with increasing spams. If your system still uses the outdated anti-spam mailing system, it may no longer be able to resist the latest spam attacks; please contact business department to upgrade the system to the latest anti-spam system;


3. The system is not subject to the latest LiveUpdate. The anti-spam system of the mailing system provides a 24-hour online upgrade, constantly updating the fingerprint signature library, and timely updating, to help resist new types of spam. Please log in the anti-spam management interface for updating. If the updating service of anti-spam mailing system is not purchased for your system, please contact the business department to purchase this service content;

There may be a variety of templates for the bounced email, but the notification information are roughly the same. The following is a description of some of the bounced email information:

1. The recipient is invalid. The notification information includes invalid address, User unknown, user is not found, etc. Please check whether the email address of the recipient is filled in correctly and try to send it again;


2. The server machine of the mailing system could not be found. Generally, the notification information is Sorry, I couldn't find any host named sian.com. In most cases, it is simply because the domain name part of the email address is incorrectly filled in, that is, the part followed @. For example, @sina.com is filled in as sian.com by mistake. If it is not filled in wrongly, there could be a problem with the connection between your system and the other party’s mailing system. Please try the method provided in Question 4 to check. If it is indeed the question with the other party’s mailing system, please contact the other party’s administrator to solve;


3) The other party’s mailbox is full. Generally, the notification information for a bounced email is Quota      exceed or receiptor's      mailbox is full; it is because the other party’s mailbox has exceeded the capacity allowed by the system; you can only ask the other party to delete some emails, so that the mailbox has extra capacity space to receive your email;


4. The server of the other party refuses to receive emails. Generally, the notification information for a bounced email is 552      Error: content rejected, which indicates that the server of the other party refuses to receive emails sent from your mailing system; you need to contact the mailing system administrator of the other party through other means to understand and explain the situation to release the limit of the other party’s email server. If you are really in a hurry to send an email, you can try to use the ID of another email server to send the email to the other party;

Where, the available size of attachment for user mailbox can be limited by modifying Available Email Size limit (unit: K):


As the maximum available email size includes email main text and attachment, if users need to receive large attachments, they should expand the limit value of the content by conversion. Since the digit encoding will make the final email size to be rather large in actual operation, we recommend that you use a slightly larger value than the actual limit when modifying the setting, e.g., if the user email (including attachment(s)) limit is 10 M, the maximum size of email can be received is 12 M. The limit of attachment can be sent is in a similar way.

Set the match filter conditions of IP and email address according to the requirements and select required actions to be executed according to the navigation. You can click **instructions** to learn unfamiliar situation:

Set match filter conditions of IP and email addresses according to the requirements. If multiple conditions are filled in at the same time, the corresponding rule action will only be triggered if multiple conditions are matched at the same time. The condition setting can be divided into four categories:

1. Emails from an IP address


The sender address is filled in with *, IP field is filled in with ip address required to be filtered.

1. Emails from an email address


Destination email address is filled in Sender address and recipient address, e.g., abc@abc.com, the filling content of IP needs to be processed separately. We recommended that you set rules for blacklist. IP address is filled in with 0.0.0.0-255.255.255, which means that for any IP connection, this rule is triggered to filter the connection requests; when set white list, IP address field should be left as blank, which means the system does not need to trigger this rule when the user perform connections, but determine white list users by senders’ addresses during the process that system receives emails. Other types of rules that need to be set can also be referenced above. In short, when ip address is filled in with 0.0.0.0-255.255.255, it means that for any IP connection, it will trigger the rules to determine connection operation; when IP addresses is not filled in with content, it means that the user connection process is not filtered. In the meanwhile, the sender and recipient address settings support reverse operation, i.e., !uid1@domain.com, uid2@domain.com is address reverse operation, if the first character is “!” , it means that other users other than filled in addresses (e.g.:”! 1@1.com, 2@2.com, 3@3.com” mean that all users other than 1@1.com, 2@2.com, 3@3.com match the rule)

1. The email addresses from a domain


Directly fill in domain name “abc.com” in the field of email address, which means that all email address under the domain name; “.abc.com” represents all abc.com and sub-domain users.

1 Emails from email address of an IP


Destination IP address is filled in the IP address and destination email address is filled in the email address. A number with the range from 1 to 1,000 is needed to be filled in the Priority Level field. The bigger the number, the higher the priority. Expiration date (Blank indicates an expiration date without rules).

Set rule name and match keyword content. Keyword filter type can be used to set filter keywords including heading, subject, body attachment name. Then select the operations to be executed.

Check the check box at the right side of “use regular expression” to create keyword filter rules using regular expression. E.g., “.*” represents 0 or multiple characters,”\” is the escape character, e.g., fill in “.*\.exe” in “Attachment Name Keyword”, and check the “regular expression”, it means that it will filter all emails with the attachment expanded-name of .exe. See Use Manual for Anti-spam Management for detailed regular expression use instructions.

Let’s take an example of how to create a rule by filtering emails containing the keyword “invoice for issuance”:

1. Select operation of “Reject delivery”;


2. Fill in “invoice for issuance” in the “Matching Keywords” or fill in “invoice.{0,100}for.{0,100}issuance.{0,100}” after selecting the regular expression, with the rest items being default values;


3. Name the keyword rule, example, “invoice for issuance” and click **OK** to confirm.




2.4.4      Some parameter descriptions in global settings

1. Basic settings


The limit of recipient number (from external site)

Rule description: if the administrator set it as “15”, it means that when user a of the site receives emails of user b from an external site, each email can contain 15 recipients.

If the rule is triggered, rcpt to command returns "450 Requested mail action not taken: too much recipient\r\n"

The maximum size of email sent by an outside sender

rule description: it means that the maximum size of an email sent by a user of external site to the users of this site cannot exceed 51200KB.

If the rule is triggered, the email will not be delivered

When the content of Mail From command is blank

Rule description: when users of this site send emails, if the email scoring exceeds the threshold, whether to deliver the email

If the rule is triggered: data command returns "550 Requested action not taken: mail %s is rejected\r\n”, the emails will not be delivered.

1. Error number control


The maximum number of SMTP verification failure for each connection

Rule description: for SMTP verification, in a nutshell, the system requires users to provide an account name and password before they can login the SMTP server. The purpose of adding SMTP verification is to protect users from spam. Limit the number of failures of SMTP verification for each connection to prevent repeated attempts of passwords

If the rule is triggered: mail from command returns "550 Requested mail action not taken: too much fail authentications\r\n” and disconnects

Maximum number of commands for each connection can be accepted

Rule description: limit the number of commands for each connection to prevent the client from sending too many commands. If a user SMTP verification fails for more than 30 times within a connection, the system disconnects.

If the rule is triggered: mail form or rcpt to command returns "450 Requested mail action not taken: too much command\r\n” and disconnects

Maximum number of command errors for each connection can be accepted

Rule description: because the SMTP communication protocol is based on the unit of commands, but some software sending spam, its command will often go wrong, causing the system server to consume resources to handle these commands. With this configuration, you can control the resources used by the system to handle the spam software (e.g., if the number of failed commands exceeds the limit within a connection, the system disconnects).

If the rule is triggered: if the number of failed commands exceeds the limit, the system will automatically disconnect.

1. Frequency control for user sending emails


The maximum number of emails sent by users per 15 minutes/the maximum number of emails sent by users per day

Rule description: record the number of emails sent by a user within 15 minutes/day

If the rule is triggered: because the system will record the number of emails sent by the user, if the administrator sets the upper limit to 20 and 200 respectively, when a user of the system sends more than any of them (20 or 200), the next email (or prompt cannot be sent) will not be received by the other users.

Limit of total number of times per email sent by users per 15 minutes/limit of total number of times per email sent by users per day

Rule description: it records the total number of times a user sends an email within 15 minutes/day. If the general upper limit is set to "-1", it means that no upper limit will be set for the content.

1. Set the filter score threshold


Gray list filter score (default is 7, use list technology to block emails)

Rule description: use gray list and mail rating to filter emails. The higher the score, the more spam may be rated.

2.4.6      Email log trace shows that ip127.0.0.1 sends emails at regular intervals without sender or recipient and the result is: the connection is interrupted. Is it normal?

It is normal. There is a background program of sysmonitor (original in the mailing system) and it is used to periodically check whether the system is running.



2.4.7      Email log trace shows the result: trigger gray list and return for resending. What is the reason? How to deal with this?

When an email is sent to another mailbox that has never sent an email, the system will perform gray list filtering. If the gray list is hit, the sender is requested to send it again after an interval. If the same email is sent within the interval, it would be rejected. The only solution is waiting or setting the corresponding white list.



2.4.8      In the basic settings of anti-spam management interface, what does recipient count limit mean (from external sites)?

It refers to the limit of recipient number for emails sent from external sites.



2.4.9      What happens if I set “Yes” to whether filter emails sent by this site?

2.4.10    What does the gray list mean? What happens when the gray list is triggered?

The gray list indicates that the system suspects the email is not delivered by the normal mailing system; the email that triggers the gray list will be temporarily rejected and will be received after the sender's email server re-delivers it.



2.4.11    What does the “Use Spam Fingerprint Filter" in the advanced settings mean?

Extract the email fingerprint features and match them with those in the system spam feature library. Reject those matching emails.



2.4.12    What does spf mean? What will happen if I don’t tick the SPF authentication?

SPF is a sender IP verification mechanism used to block email spoofing. For example, 163.com creates an SPF record that declares its email server IP address segment. When a recipient receives an email that purports to be from 163.com, it can determine whether the sender's IP is in the IP segment declared by 163.com by querying the SPF record. SPF is very helpful in blocking email spoofing and it is recommended to open it.



2.4.13    What happens when it is ticked not to have the RBL check?

Realtime Blackhole List (RBL) is a dynamic list of server IP addresses whose owners are spam sources. RBL is very helpful in spam filtering and it is recommended to open it.



2.4.14    What does the Fingerprint Counter Filter Threshold filter?

FingerPrint determines the similarity of two emails by extracting their features. When the number of emails that are determined to be similar reaches or exceeds the threshold, the system will take the similar emails that are delivered later as spam and reject them.



2.4.15    Why should I update the feature library?

Updating the feature library is a real-time anti-spam function provided by Anti-spam GT. It can update the filtering feature database from the remote feature data center in real time via the network connection, so as to ensure the system has the latest filtering rule information and can filter out newly discovered spam.

By default, the system has been set to automatically connect to the remote feature data center and complete the update at regular intervals:


The page shows that the updated feature library has an expiration date of 2009-06-30 (June 30, 2009), indicating that the system now has the function of automatic update; however, if you want to use the service after 2009-06-30 (June 30, 2009), you will need to contact the customer service personnel.
