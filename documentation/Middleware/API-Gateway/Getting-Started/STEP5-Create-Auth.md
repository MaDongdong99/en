# Access Authorization for API

The process of access authorization of API means that the API provider authorizes to API caller. The authorization process is divided into two parts:

- API caller creates and provides **Access Key **. The access key (APIKey/APISecret) represents the identity of the requester.

- API provider authorizes the API group to API caller.

When API provider or the customer of API provider needs to test the API calling, it is necessary to create the access key as the identity of requester, and then the API provider authorizes the API group to API caller during the access authorization.
