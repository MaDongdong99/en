# Backend Service Signature


The Backend Signature Key Pair employs backend signature verification to guarantee your backend security after your real backend is requested by JD Cloud user AK/SK(Access Key/Access Key Secret) at the gateway.

Once the JD Cloud AK/SK key pair is bounded to API grouping, the AK/SK will be added and shown when the API under the grouping is requested by the gateway, the identity of gateway is verified by your backend through verifying the signature character string.
