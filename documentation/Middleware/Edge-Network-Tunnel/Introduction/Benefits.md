Low cost: Based on mass edge nodes, forward the data through the network penetration service. Use low-cost idle resources to obtain broader network bandwidth;

Low delay: We select the nearest point and the nearest route for the data relying on wide coverage and large amounts of edge nodes. The contents will not returned to the cloud center but directly forwarded by node connection or an edge node nearer the terminal, shortening the link, so as to make lower network delay and better experience;

High quality: Select the corresponding penetration plan according to the network status among nodes and select the best plan from multiple available links, capable of dynamically adjusting links, so as to reduce network transmission time delay and achieve high-quality penetration rate;

Safe and reliable: Support UDP protocol, compatible with WebRTC and STUN clients, provide high-reliability data transmission service; peering connection, which is featured with non-passing of interoperability, guarantees data security; network security isolation, certificate encryption and automatic monitoring capability guarantee the channel security;

Interconnected resource: Provide broad-bandwidth, high-quality resource interconnection service, help users connect the resource communication links and achieve peering connection of data;

Easy-to-access: Provide perfect SDK, facilitate direct access of users and achieve end-to-end connection and content forwarding, so that users do not need to develop and deploy the forwarding service by themselves.
