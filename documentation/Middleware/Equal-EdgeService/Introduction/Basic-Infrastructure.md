**Key Component:**<br>
Serving as an edge computation platform, in addition to underlayer service management capacities, JEES also provides some basic function modules which are divided into a cloud management platform (cloud) and a local operation package (edge), with details as follows:
- The module epnc-core is the only entrance of edge node and cloud center, which is mainly responsible for receiving edge node information report and distributing corresponding computation task;

- The module epnc-stats is responsible for collecting usage information of edge node and computation task and for saving the same in the time sequence database and Monitoring;

- The module epnc-scheduler is responsible for scheduling the arrangement task submitted by users to appropriate edge nodes;

- The module epnc-config is responsible for saving the arrangement task information submitted by users;

- The primary program epnc-edge of local operation package is responsible for receiving management of cloud instructions and service instances, such as start, exit and protection, and for managing userâ€™s computation tasks at the edge side. Two operation modes are supported, i.e., Native progress mode and Docker container mode.
