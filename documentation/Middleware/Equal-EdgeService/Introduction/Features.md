We provide users with a hash rate resource pool which aggregate idle resources such as computation, storage and network for unified management, provides a computation and storage resource pool of super-low delay (<5ms) and low cost in China, build a database based on a set of middleware system of resource pool, Serverless and others.

The following core functions are equipped now:<br>
**Safe access of massive edge node**: Based on massive edge node construction, wide coverage and average delay<5ms; Support node access of multiple terminal types;<br>
**Edge application life cycle management**: Based on the distributed system architecture, application instances can be created and managed via a one-stop way; it is compatible with docker ecology and can help user management by distributing images;<br>
**Intelligent scheduling**: Intelligently select nodes based on hash rate demands and edge node load; the perfect monitoring and service system is based on intelligent monitoring and scheduling for service quality;<br>
**Automatic operation and maintenance**: The application upgrade mode is smooth and predictable and upgrade risk is controllable; Monitoring is integrated to give real-time notice on network environment; and the cloud distributes, manages, monitors and make operation and maintenance on tasks for edge application in a unified way
