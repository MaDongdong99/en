JD Cloud Equal Edge Service (JEES) is a distributed edge service provided by JD Cloud to users, which fully makes use of JD Cloud’s capacities such as resource reservation and scheduling management for edge network and fuses resources of network, computation, storage and application via the node way at the edge side. Thus, it becomes an open platform. It meets users critical demands for real-time business demand, rapid application deployment, nearby data processing, remote control and content distribution; it can flexibly configure and manage large-scale edge computation application, accelerate launch of edge intelligence, expand computation capacity to user’s site and provides users with nearby edge intelligence service of super-low delay and low cost.

​**Basic concept:**<br>
Equal Edge Service: Distributed hash rate resource platform set up based on JD Cloud and user-side edge nodes;

Edge node: According to different scenario needs and delay tolerance degrees, selection of, including but not limited to, local device side node, local LAN node (gateway, controller and control system server), WAN node (base station and CDN) can be made at any place except the cloud computing center;

Node resource: Include CPU, memory, system disk, data disk, network bandwidth, etc.
