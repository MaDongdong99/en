## Change Configuration
Select clusters to be expanded in the list page of JCS for Elasticsearch. Click **Operation-More-Change Configuration** to set the cluster parameter changes.</br>
The changeable options include "node specification", "single point storage specification", "number of nodes" and "dedicated master nodes", and only the configuration upgrade of one of the configuration attributes can be modified at a time. If you intend to modify several configuration attributes, please make another modification correspondingly. After changing the configuration, the cluster details can be queried to see if the configuration change is successful.
