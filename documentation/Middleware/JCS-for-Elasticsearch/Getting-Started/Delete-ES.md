## Delete ES
When the user has completed the data search business and does not need to continue to use a cluster, he can delete it in the “Operation” column of the cluster list; click **Delete** and confirm to delete the corresponding cluster. Since the data cannot be recovered after the cluster is deleted, please operate cautiously.
