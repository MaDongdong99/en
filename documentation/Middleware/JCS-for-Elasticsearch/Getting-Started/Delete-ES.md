## Delete Cluster
When the user has completed the data search business and does not need to continue to use a cluster, this cluster can be deleted. Since the data cannot be recovered after the cluster is deleted, please operate cautiously.

### Operation Steps
1. Log in [JCS for Elasticsearch Console]](https://es-console.jdcloud.com/clusters).</br>
2. Click **Operation-Deletion** on the list page and execute deletion after confirming the popup.</br>
