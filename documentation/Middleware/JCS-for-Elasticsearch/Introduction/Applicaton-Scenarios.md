## Application Scenarios
### Log Analysis
JCS for Elasticsearch can collect unstructured, semi-structured and structured log information. It loads the capture and preprocessing log data into JCS for Elasticsearch, and combines with Kibana for full-text search, statistics & analysis and multi-dimensional chart display, so as to get valuable information about users and application programs.</br>
Real-time retrieval: Data can be retrieved in seconds to minutes.</br>
Kibana visualization analysis: It provides a multi-dimensional chart display of data.</br>

### Application/Site Search
Application/site search provides an efficient way for users to obtain key information. Users can complete the quick retrieval of full-text contents of e-commerce products and mobile applications, etc. It supports the creation of advanced search and screening conditions; classifies and counts the eligible products at the same time; highlights the contents being searched; and provides near real-time indexing and accurate positioning from data warehousing to the completion of retrieval.</br>
