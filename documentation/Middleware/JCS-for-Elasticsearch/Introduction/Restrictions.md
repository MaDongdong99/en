## Restrictions
For security reasons, JCS for Elasticsearch cluster is constructed in Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and the writing and search of the cluster data is also limited within the same VPC network.

```
Note:
* After the JCS for Elasticsearch cluster is created successfully, the switchover of VPC network is not supported. You need to conduct the business plan deployment in advance when you create the cluster.

```
