## Dedicated Primary Node

JCS for Elasticsearch supports the setting of dedicated primary nodes to improve cluster stability. Dedicated primary nodes can be checked on the page of [Create Cluster](https://es-console.jdcloud.com/create) when creating the clusters or set by [More]-[Change Configuration] after creating a cluster.

```
Note:
* We suggest that 3 dedicated primary nodes be assigned to each cluster by default in case of enabling the dedicated primary nodes. Such 3 dedicated primary nodes can provide additional backup nodes when any primary node fails, to select a new primary node.
```
