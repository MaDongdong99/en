## Billing Rules
Two billing methods are provided to JCS for Elasticsearch, including the method of pay by configuration and another one of monthly package. The billing method of pay by configuration is very flexible, which can be enabled and disabled whenever, and the billing is made based on the actual usage duration. Compared with the billing method of pay by configuration, the monthly package will provide more discounts, thus being suitable for the long-term users. For details, please refer to billing method
