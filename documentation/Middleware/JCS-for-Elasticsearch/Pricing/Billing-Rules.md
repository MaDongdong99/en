## Billing Rules
**On-demand billing**: The purchase method is flexible; it can be enabled and disabled anytime, and charged according to the actual usage duration. Respectively for the number of nodes, node specifications and node storage capacity. The billing is made every full hour in the unit of natural hours; where the duration is less than 1 hour, it is deemed as 1 hour for billing.</br>

**Discount Package**: Applicable to node instances; users can purchase the ES node instance usage hours quota in advance, which provides a larger discount than on-demand billing. For long-term users, this method is recommended, and the consumption exceeding the quota is charged by on-demand billing method.
