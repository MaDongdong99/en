**Q: How can I select the specification of calling chain analysis service?**

A: You need select specification  for calling chain analysis service according to the TPS of your reported chain log calling. The factors affecting the TPS include the requests (Q) per second at the system entrance, average internal calls (C) occurred for each request during internal processing in the cluster, the data sampling rate (R) of calling chain that you have configured in the configuration file. You can carry out estimation by Q*C*R and select the configuration that is a bit lower than the estimate value, report TPS and make expansion as required according to the actual log in the monitoring data at the later period.



**Q: How is my configuration data stored?**

**Q: Does the Calling Chain Dependency Mapping cannot be seen in the Calling Chain Analysis Service?**

A: Self-detection Method:

- Whether a reference dependency is added.

- Configuration: Whether the domain, port, backend service address is correctly configured.

- url needs a complete path.

- Whether the network is working or not

- According to official advice, the sampling rate is recommended to be 0.01 instead of 1, and jdsf can support 0.1 at the present, but the usersâ€™ bandwidth needs to meet the required conditions.
