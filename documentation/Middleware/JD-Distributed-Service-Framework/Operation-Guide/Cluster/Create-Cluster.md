####   Note:
-  The registration center is deployed directly in the userâ€™s VPC and will occupy different counts of private IP according to the different specifications selected by the user. Please ensure that the selected subnet dynamic ip is sufficient.
- Once the resource is created, it cannot be migrated to another region.
-  If you do not have permission for the current region, you will not be able to create a new resource.
-  For creation, cluster names cannot be repeated, nor can they be repeated in different regions.

###   Step 3: Click Create Registration Center, and fill in the registration information.
You should enter cluster names in turn, select cluster network and subnet ID, select count of service instance and fill in description. Then click Save to complete the creation process.

The time required to create the instance is affected by the selected instance type. It takes about 5-15 minutes, please wait patiently.
