# Registration Center

The registration center is the administration center of JD Distributed Service, realizing service registration and discovery. When a user creates a namespace, a registration center will be created at the same time. When the namespace is deleted, the registration center information will be synchronously deleted.

Functions provided by the registration center comprise adjusting specification and configuration, monitoring information, etc.
