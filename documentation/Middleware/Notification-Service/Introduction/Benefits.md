# Benefits

### Dynamic Expansion

JD Notification Service can be dynamically extended based on the actual service condition, leaving users free from the complexities such as resource scaling and threshold monitoring and focused on business implementation and growth.

### Simple and Easy to Use

Users can start using highly reliable, highly available message notification service for serverless architectures through a simple Console interaction interface or SDK calls.

### Multi-terminal

Message broadcast at multi-terminal nodes, including HTTP/S, SMS, Email, and message notification without a service application, can be easily realized through the message notification service.

### Low Cost

Users do not need to pay for the purchase, installation, development, and operation and maintenance of infrastructure. They also do not need to consume a long time for purchase and development. They only need to create a subject, dynamically expand it according to the service condition regarding to their own business, and pay by usage, which greatly reduces the user's cost of use.

### Stable and Reliable

Messages are automatically stored redundantly in multiple availability zones to ensure the reliability of messages. Besides, redundant message retry policies are provided to ensure that messages can be delivered whenever possible.

### Data Security

Notification Service can securely isolate user resources based on the IAM and meet the encryption and reception requirements of sensitive data. Users can use the server-side encryption function to encrypt the message body to ensure data security.
