# Benefits

### Simple and Easy to Use

Users can start using highly reliable, infinitely scalable queue services for distributed architectures, cloud architectures, and serverless architectures through a simple Console interaction interface or SDK calls.

### Unlimited Extensibility

It is unnecessary for users to know the quantity and specification of the required infrastructures or worry about the pressure brought from burst business growth to applications because the Queue Service can be zoomed without awareness along with the running of users’ applications. The standard queue has no limit of TPS and can have unlimited throughput in theory.

### Low Cost

Users do not need to pay for the purchase, installation, configuration, and operation and maintenance of the previous infrastructure. They do not need to consume a long time for purchase and configuration. They simply create, dynamically expand, and pay according to the usage of their own business, which reduces the user's cost of use.​                                                                                                                    
### No Operation and Maintenance

Users do not need to deploy and manage infrastructure and underlayer applications to use highly available, automatically pulled, dynamically extended queue services.

### Reliable Transfer

Users do not need to configure or manually add redundant message storage to ensure data reliability without losing messages. Messages in the queue service are stored in multiple Availability Zones in multiple replicas to ensure message reliability.

### Data Security

The queue service can meet the encryption and reception requirements of sensitive data. Users can use the server-side encryption (SSE) function to encrypt the message main text to ensure data security. In addition, the Queue Service integrates Key Management Service (KMS), which enables users to centrally manage the keys of encrypted data and record the usage of keys to meet the needs of monitoring and auditing of users.
