# Core Concepts

| **Terminology**         | **Interpretation**                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Queue                 | Logical Unit for Storing Messages in Queue Service                                 |
| Standard Queue             | There is theoretically no limited TPS cap for a standard queue, supporting best effort message sequencing and at least one message delivery |
| FIFO Queue             | FIFO queue supports strict consistency in the order in which messages are sent and received, and precise one-time message processing |
| Dead Letter Queue             | Messages will be sent to the dead letter queue after exceeding the maximum number of receiving times; these messages can be isolated in the dead letter queue to determine the cause of their processing failure |
| Life Cycle of Message       | The longest liveness time of a message in the queue; after the message is sent to the queue at the time specified by this parameter, the message will be deleted; the unit is second, with the range of 1 minute to 14 days, regardless of whether the message has been taken. |
| Waiting Time for Receiving Message Round Robin | For a long round robin waiting time, a message consumption request returns a response only when a valid message is taken or in a long round robin waiting time, in seconds, with the valid value range of 0 - 20 seconds. |
| Visibility Time-out Period       | The length of time during which the messages received from a queue are not visible to other receivers; the unit is second, with the valid range of 0 seconds to 12 hours. |
| Message Maximum Length         | Size of the largest message received in the message queue, in KB, with the valid value range of 1 to 256KB |
| Delivery Delay             | The time that the queue message is delayed to be delivered to the queue; the unit is second, and it must be between 0 second and 15 minutes |
| Deduplication Based on Message Content   | FIFO queue generates the message duplicated data deletion ID of message through SHA-256 Hash; if it is not checked, the message duplicated data deletion ID needs to be provided by the user himself/herself. Within the 5-minute message deduplication interval, it will judge whether if it is a duplicated message based on the message duplicated data deletion ID Queue Service. In case of duplication, only one message will be consumed by the user |
| Message                 | Carrier of data transmission in Queue Service                                     |
| Message ID                | Unique identifier of a message, which is automatically generated by the Queue Service                         |
| Message Handle             | User can obtain a message handle that can operate the message of each message which he/she pulls from the queue. Within the visibility time-out period range, the user can use this message handle to modify / delete the message, and if the visibility time-out period is exceeded, the user needs to obtain the message handle again in order to get the operation on the message again |
| Number of Visible Messages           | Total number of messages waiting for round robin without being deleted in the queue                       |
| Number of Invisible Messages         | Total number of messages being subject to round robin in the queue                                   |
| Number of Delayed Messages           | Total number of messages in the status of delayed delivery in the queue                             |
| Message Attribute             | You can add structured attributes that identify messages beyond the content of the message                     |
