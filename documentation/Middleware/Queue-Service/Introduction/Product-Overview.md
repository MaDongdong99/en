# Product Overview
The Queue Service is a fully hosted message Queue Service based on serverless architecture. For using the Queue Service, users do not need to conduct complex infrastructure configurations to meet high availability of both data and service, or make frequent expansion for performance neck. They just need to focus on business implementation. With simple console operations or SDK calls, a highly reliable, highly available and infinitely scalable message queue can be built. Whatâ€™s more, the service is pay-as-you-go, without any charge.
