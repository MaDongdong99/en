## **Expansion of the Current Data Center of the Enterprise**

### **Expand the existing enterprise data center, and cope with explosive business growth**

- Business scenario: in the early stage of business growth, small-scale physical machine clusters can satisfy user needs. However, with the expansion of the marketing activities and the explosive growth of the business scale, the original physical machine room can be deployed with limited seats. Only the public cloud can be selected an elastic option to quickly deploy services to satisfy user needs. Enterprise business has an obvious wave crest and trough. It will result in considerable waste, if IT is constructed according to the crest needs. However, it cannot meet the busy business demands if constructed according to the trough demands.
- Recommended configuration: IDC, Virtual Private Cloud, Direct Connection (primary), VPN (standby), Load Balancer, VM auto scaling, and Cloud Database, etc.
