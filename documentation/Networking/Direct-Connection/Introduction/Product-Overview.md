#### Integral Structure

##### Direct Connection Service vs VPN

| Product Advantages | Direct Connection Service | VPN |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Good Network Quality | Access to JD Cloud network through a dedicated physical link, enjoy Intranet-level communication, low network latency and low packet loss rate. | Communicating with shared public network resources cannot guarantee low network delay or packet loss rate.   |
| Safe and Reliable | The physical link is exclusive to the users who access it. Without risk of data leakage, it enjoys high security and meets the needs of customers with high security requirements such as games enterprises, financial enterprises, and government enterprises. | Public network-based encrypted communication, which can meet the security requirements of network transmission for general customers. |
| High Transmission Bandwidth | A single physical link supports a maximum of 10 Gbps of bandwidth, which can satisfy customers with data bulk business. It supports multiple dedicated lines for ECMP, and superimposes the bandwidth limit on the basis of ensuring service availability. | Network bandwidth is limited by the bandwidth of public IP.                               |
