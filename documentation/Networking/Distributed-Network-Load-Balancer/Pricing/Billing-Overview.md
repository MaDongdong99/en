# Billing Overview

## Charging Items
The charge items for DNLB products include the DNLB instance fee and the flexible elastic IP fee.

- DNLB instance fee: The current DNLB instance is free in all regions and all AZs.
- Elastic IP fee: If the DNLB is Public Network Load Balancer, the elastic IP associated to it will be charged separately. For details, see [Elastic IP-Billing Rules](http://docs.jdcloud.com/elastic -ip/price-overview). If DNLB is Private Network Load Balancer, this fee will not be charged.

## Enabling Description
If you purchased elastic IP when you enabled DNLB, to ensure your normal use, your account balance must be no less than RMB 50. If the account amount is less than RMB 50, you can use it after recharging.

## Amount Overdue/Expiry Description

### Pay By Configuration
The DNLB instance is always free so there is no case for arrears. If the elastic IP associated to DNLB is in arrears, it will affect the use of the elastic IP. For details, see [Elastic IP-Arrears/Expiration Description](http://docs.jdcloud.com/elastic-ip /billing-overview) At this time, the DNLB Load Balancer function on the public network traffic cannot be used.
