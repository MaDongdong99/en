# Configuration Description

This Tutorial will guide the users to create a container in the Virtual Private Cloud and to make the container associate Elastic IP so as to realize the containerâ€™s access to the public network. This Tutorial is applicable to the scenario where the container provides outward services.

## Before Creation

- Make sure the users have registered the users' JD Cloud account and finished real-name verification.

- Make sure the users have created an Elastic IP which has not associated resources.

## Procedures

Step 1: Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Step 2: Create a container instance based on VPC the users have created.

Step 3: During the process of creating a container instance, the users can choose to assign an Elastic IP or no Elastic IP. This Tutorial is based on the assignment of no Elastic IP.

Step 4: Make the container instance the users have created associate Elastic IP through container instance associating Elastic IP or Elastic IP associating container instance.

## Follow-up Tests

After the container instance associates the Elastic IP, the users can test the connectivity of the Elastic IP by using Ping Elastic IP addresses.
