# Configuration Description

This Tutorial will guide the users to create a Load Balancer in the Virtual Private Cloud and to associate the Load Balancer with Elastic IP so as to realize the service distribution of public networkâ€™s access from Load Balancer to the backend Virtual Machines. This Tutorial is applicable to the scenario where a number of Virtual Machines provide outward services and the traffic distribution is required, such as large websites.

## Before Creation

- Make sure the users have registered the users' JD Cloud account and finished real-name verification.

- Make sure the users have created an Elastic IP which has not associated resources.

## Procedures

Step 1: Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Step 2: Create a Load Balancer based on VPC the users have created.

Step 3: During the process of creating a Load Balancer, the users can choose to assign an Elastic IP or no Elastic IP. This Tutorial is based on the assignment of no Elastic IP.

Step 4: Associate the Load Balancer the users have created with Elastic IP through Load Balancer associating with Elastic IP or Elastic IP associating with Load Balancer.

## Follow-up Tests

After the Load Balancer associates with the Elastic IP, the users can test the connectivity of the Elastic IP by using Ping Elastic IP addresses.
