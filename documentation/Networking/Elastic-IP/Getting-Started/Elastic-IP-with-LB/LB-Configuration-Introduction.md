# Configuration Description

This Tutorial will guide the users to create a Load Balancer in the Virtual Private Cloud and to make the Load Balancer associate Elastic IP so as to realize the diversion function of Load Balancer during the public networkâ€™s access to the Virtual Machine. This Tutorial is applicable to the scenario where a number of Virtual Machines provide outward services and the traffic distribution is required, such as large websites.

## Before Creation

- Make sure the users have registered the users' JD Cloud account and finished real-name verification.

- Make sure the users have created an Elastic IP which has not associated resources.

## Procedures

Step 1: Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Step 2: Create a Load Balancer based on VPC the users have created.

Step 3: During the process of creating a Load Balancer, the users can choose to assign an Elastic IP or no Elastic IP. This Tutorial is based on the assignment of no Elastic IP.

Step 4: Make the Load Balancer the users have created associate Elastic IP through Load Balancer associating Elastic IP or Elastic IP associating Load Balancer.

## Follow-up Tests

After the Load Balancer associates the Elastic IP, the users can test the connectivity of the Elastic IP by using Ping Elastic IP addresses.
