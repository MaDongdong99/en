# Configuration Description

This Tutorial will guide the users to create a Virtual Machine in the Virtual Private Cloud and to make the Virtual Machine associate Elastic IP so as to realize the Virtual Machineâ€™s access to the public network. This Tutorial is applicable to the scenario where the Virtual Machine provides outward services, such as building websites, BBS and personal blogs.

## Before Creation

- Make sure the users have registered the users' JD Cloud account and finished real-name verification.

- Make sure the users have created an Elastic IP which has not associated resources.

## Procedures

Step 1: Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Step 2: Create a virtual machine based on VPC the users have created.

Step 3: During the creation of a Virtual Machine, the users can choose to assign an Elastic IP or no Elastic IP. This Tutorial is based on the assignment of no Elastic IP.

Step 4: Make the Virtual Machine the users have created associate Elastic IP through Virtual Machine associating Elastic IP or Elastic IP associating Virtual Machine.

## Follow-up Tests

After the Virtual Machine associates the Elastic IP, the users can test the connectivity of the Elastic IP by using Ping Elastic IP addresses.
