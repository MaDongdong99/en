# Key Benefits

## Complete Elasticity

Currently all JD Cloud’s Public IP addresses are Elastic IP addresses. An Elastic IP address, either from independent application or from a package order with instances, can be associated to or disassociated from a cloud resource at any time.

## Multiple Resource Type Support

An Elastic IP address can be associated to virtual machine instances, native containers, load balancers, and NFV instances to provide public network access.

## Multiple Billing Type Support

Users can select an appropriate billing type, according to business requirements, from the types of **Monthly Package**, **Pay by configuration** and **payment by Consumption".

## Flexible Bandwidth Modification

Users can modify an Elastic IP address’ bandwidth as traffic requirement changes. The modification will take effect immediately.
