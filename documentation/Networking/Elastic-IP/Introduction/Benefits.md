# Features

## Complete Elasticity

* Currently all JD Cloud’s Public IP addresses are Elastic IP addresses. An Elastic IP address, either from independent application or from a package order with instances, can be associated to or disassociated from a cloud resource at any time.

## Multiple Resource Type Support

An Elastic IP address can be associated to virtual machine instances, native containers, load balancers, and NFV instances to provide public network access.

## Multiple Billing Type Support

users can select an appropriate billing type, according to business requirements, from the types of monthly package, pay by configuration and pay by consumption.

## Flexible Bandwidth Modification

users can modify an Elastic IP address’ bandwidth as traffic requirement changes. The modification will be effective immediately.
