# Key Benefits

## Complete Elasticity

Currently all JD Cloud & AI’s Public IP addresses are Elastic IP addresses. An Elastic IP address, either from independent application or from a package order with instances, can be associated to or disassociated from a cloud resource at any time.

## Support Multiple Public IP Types

The Elastic IP supports the Standard Elastic IP and Edge Elastic IP, which respectively provide public network access capability for resources in central availability zone and edge zone in each region and can be applicable to different business scenarios.

## Multiple Resource Type Support

An Elastic IP address can be associated to virtual machine instances, native containers, load balancers, and NFV instances to provide public network access.

## Multiple Billing Type Support

Users can select an appropriate billing type, according to business requirements, from the types of **Monthly Package**, **Pay by Configuration** and **Pay by Consumption**.

## Flexible Bandwidth Modification

Users can modify an Elastic IP address’ bandwidth as traffic requirement changes. The modification will take effect immediately.
