# Core Concept
The following concepts and interpretations used in the Elastic IP help document are Listed for reference.

| English | Chinese | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Elastic IP | 弹性公网IP | Elastic IP is Public IP that can be independently applied for, and supports dynamically associating and disassociating Virtual Machine, container, Load Balancer, and NFV Instance.
| Instance | 实例 |Instance is a basic service unit of cloud computing provided by JD Cloud, providing computing services with flexible and scalable processing capacity. It includes CPU, memory, operating system, storage, network, and security. Every resource has a variety of specifications to choose to meet the personalized needs of different business. |
| NFV Instance | NFV实例 | NFV is short for Network Function Virtualization. NFV Instance is a virtual network device which has traditional network functions, and is realized with the use of software technologies and virtualization technologies. For example: VPN Gateway and NAT Gateway VM Instances created with image.|
| BGP | 边界网关协议 | BGP is short for Border Gateway Protocol. Network operators declare IP address fields to each other through BGP protocol. BGP IP can realize single IP with multiple IP providers to achieve high-speed access by the users of different operators.|
| Region | 地域 | Different regions mean different geographic regions. Currently, JD Cloud has four regions: cn-north-1, cn-south-1, cn-east-1, and cn-east-2.
| AZ | 可用区 | AZ is short for Availability Zone. There can be a number of AZs in a region, and the resources in different AZs are separated from each other to ensure their high availability. The AZs are normally interconnected by IP providers with low latency and high bandwidth.
| VPN Gateway | VPN网关 | VPN is shot for Virtual Private Network. VPN Gateway is an Internet-based product that connects an enterprise data center to the cloud VPC in a secure manner with the channel encryption technology.
| NAT Gateway | NAT网关 | NAT is short for Network Address Translator. NAT Gateway can provide access to enterprise-level VPC public network for users.
| Load Balancer | 负载均衡 | The Load Balancer can distribute traffic to a number of Virtual Machines, improving application system availability by eliminating single points of fault.
