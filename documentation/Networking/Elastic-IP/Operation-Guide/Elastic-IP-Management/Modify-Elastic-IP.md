For Monthly Package, the configuration upgrade needs user to make up expense of the bandwidth difference, while in the situation of configuration downgrade, expense of bandwidth difference will be converted to duration; for Pay by Configuration billing will be issued according to the modified bandwidth after the configuration upgrade or downgrade; for Pay by Consumption, the bandwidth is only used to limit the rate and does not affect the actual billing.
