# Modify Elastic IP Bandwidth

Three billing types of Elastic IP configuration upgrade and downgrade are supported by JD Cloud. Among them, the configuration upgrade needs to make up the bandwidth difference for the monthly package billing type while the configuration downgrade bandwidth difference will be converted to duration; the bill of the billing by configuration will be issued according to the modified bandwidth after the configuration upgrade and downgrade; for the billing by consumption, the bandwidth is only used to limit the rate and does not affect the actual billing.
