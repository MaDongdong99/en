| Elastic Plugging | ENI is elastically hot-pluggable on a VM. The ENIs of JD Cloud & AI support elastic hot plug in the operation state of VMs which can realize the addition and removal of ENIs with no business disruption, facilitating user to create a more reliable application architecture | Ordinary VM can only be mounted with one network interface which is known as the primary network interface |
| Flexible Reuse | the VM can be assigned with several ENIs, and each of which can be assigned with several private IP addresses. The ENI of JD Cloud & AI can be assigned with several private IP addresses, each of which can be associated with a public IP address, so that a single VM can provide different service application scenarios | Ordinary VM can only be distributed one private IP address and be associated one public IP address |
| Business Separation | Different ENIs can host private network, public network and management network traffic respectively. JD Cloud & AI VM can be mounted with ENIs of multiple subnets in the VPC. Different ENIs host different traffics and provide solutions for such scenarios as virtual network devices and traffic separation etc. | One network interface of ordinary VM can host different business traffics |
| Security Enhancement | Different security group strategies can be applied to different ENIs JD Cloud & AI's ENIs provide security group strategies at the network interface level. Different ENIs can apply different security group strategies according to business traffic characteristics, realizing accurate management and control of business traffic and improving the security of solution | The same security group policy is applied for all business traffics of ordinary VM |
| Reliable Fault-tolerance | ENI supports dynamic migration between VMs in different availability zones. JD Cloud & AI provides ENIs without availability zone attribute, supports the dynamic migration of ENIs between VMs of different availability zones, realizes the high availability scheme at the availability zone level, shortens the fault time and improves the system reliability | Dynamic migration is not allowed for the network interface of ordinary VM |
