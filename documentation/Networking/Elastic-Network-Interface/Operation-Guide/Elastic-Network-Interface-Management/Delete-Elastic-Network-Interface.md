Delete ENI

JD Cloud supports deleting secondary ENI. The life cycle of the primary network interface of the VM is the same as that of the VM and can only be deleted with the VM.

## Procedures
Step 1: Log in to the console of JD Cloud and enter the Console Navigation Page.

Step 2: Select network - virtual private cloud - ENI at the navigation bar on the left side of the console to enter the ENI list page.

Step 3: Locate the ENI that the user needs to delete on the ENI list page. If the ENI is associated, and Delete is in gray, the deletion can only be performed if the ENI is disassociated first; if the ENI is disassociated, directly click Delete to perform the deletion.

Step 4 (optional): If the ENI is associated, first click Disassociate Resource to disassociate the ENI from VM.

Step 5: Click Delete to enter the ENI deletion popup.

	Description
	On the details of ENI, the shortcut operation option at the upper right corner is also provided with Delete, and the function is consistent with Delete on the List Page.

Step 6: After completing the above steps, click OK to complete the deletion for the ENI and return to the ENI list page to view the deletion of the ENI.
