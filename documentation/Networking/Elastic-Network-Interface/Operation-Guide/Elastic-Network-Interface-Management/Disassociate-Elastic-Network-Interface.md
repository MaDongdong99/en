# Disassociate ENI

JD Cloud supports the disassociation of secondary ENI from VM. Primary network interface of VM cannot be disassociated.

## Procedures

Step 1: Log in to the console of JD Cloud and enter the Console Navigation Page.

Step 2: Select network - virtual private cloud - ENI at the navigation bar on the left side of the console to enter the ENI list page.

Step 3: On the ENI list page, Disassociate Resource will be displayed if the ENI is associated.

Step 4: Click Disassociation Resource to enter the disassociation resource popup of ENI.

Step 5: Click OK in the disassociation resource popup to complete the ENI disassociation.

Step 6: Return to the ENI list page. Since it takes 5 to 8 seconds for disassociating the ENI with the VM to take effect, refresh the ENI list page after completing the association for 5 to 8 seconds to view the association status of the ENI. Please do not repeat the disassociation during the effective period of the configuration to avoid exceptions and errors.
