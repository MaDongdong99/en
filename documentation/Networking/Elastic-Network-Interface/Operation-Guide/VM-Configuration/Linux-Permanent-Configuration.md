Step 3: Execute the following command to query the name of the mounted ENI.

	# ifconfig -a

Step 4: Execute the following command to enter the network interface configuration file directory.

	# cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

Step 5: Execute the following command to create configuration file of ENI.

	# touch ifcfg-[device name]

Step 6: Execute the following command to enable editing for configuration file of ENI.

	# vi ifcfg-[device name]

Step 7: Replace and fill in the following contexts in the configuration file of ENI.

	DEVICE=[device name]
	NM_CONTROLLED=yes
	ONBOOT=yes
	IPADDR=[primary ip]
	NETMASK=[netmask]

Step 8: Execute the following command to restart the network service so that the configuration can take effect.
