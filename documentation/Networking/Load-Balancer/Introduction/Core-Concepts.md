# Core concept
The following concepts and interpretations used in the **Load Balancer** help document are listed for reference.

| Concept | Interpretation |
| :- | :- |
| Load Balancer | Business access load balancer service provides the 4-layer-based (TCP) and 7-layer-based (HTTP and HTTPS) traffic listening and forwarding service|
| Load balancer instance | Resource instance of operation load balancer service |
| VIP | Private IP address distributed to load balancer instance by system |
|Listener| defines the access traffic from load balancer to backend service for forwarding protocol, algorithm, policy, etc. |
|Backend service| defines the access traffic from load balancer to backend service for forwarding protocol, algorithm, policy, etc.|
|Virtual server group| A group of virtual machine and container instances processing forwarding request of load balancer traffic|
|Multiple availability zone |Thanks to the disaster tolerance function of multiple availability zones across machine room, the load balancer instance can be created under different availability zones|
|High availability group|A group of virtual machine instances, with auto scaling function depending on business load conditions, being associated to load balancer backend|
|Security group|A distributed and stateful virtual firewall with package filtering function, used to realize the network identity and access management to load balancer|
|Scheduling algorithm|The scheduling policy used for forwarding traffic from the load balancer to several backend servers is used in combination with the weights, so as to more flexible and reasonably realize load sharing |
|Session persistence| Also called as sticky sessions or session affinity. Session persistence refers to a functional mechanism of the load balancer, which distributes data while guaranteeing that relevant access requests from the same client can be distributed to the same server |
|Idle connection timeout| During http, https, tcp business distribution process, the load balancer will maintain two connections for each request sent by the client via the load balancer, including one connection to the client and the other one to the backend server. For managing idle connection timeout of each connection, when there are no data sent or received via the connections in the defined idle timeout period, the load balancer will shut down the two connections |
|Source IP pass-through|	A function pass through client IP to backend server, requiring corresponding configuration on the backend server in some cases|
|HTTP header field|	Information is passed through to the backend server via the HTTP header field when defining 7-layer listening|
|Health check| The load balancer will periodically and automatically detect availability of backend server, judge instances with exception, distribute business requests which are not distributed now to the instance and forward the same until the instance is recovered |
