# Core Concepts

See the following for the concepts and their interpretations used in the NAT Gateway Help Documentation.

| Noun/Concept | Interpretations |
| :- | :- |
| SNAT | SNAT, Source Network Address Translation, when accessing the Internet through NAT Gateway, the process of converting the source IP into the public network IP of NAT Gateway is called SNAT. |
| DNAT | DNAT, Destination Network Address Translation, a static mapping relationship between Public IP and port and a static mapping relationship between Private IP and port on NAT Gateway, when accessing the static IP and port of NAT Gateway from the Internet, the Destination IP and port are converted to Private IP and port to access services of Intranet, such process is called DNAT. |
| ALG | ALG, Application Level Gateway, generally, NAT only does conversion of three-layer IP and four-layer port, NAT ALG converts IP and port information in the application layer protocol payload to support normal communication across NAT Gateways between protocols. Take FTP Protocol as example, FTP generally needs to establish two links for control and data. During the establishment of data links, the FTP client will inform the server to actively connect to the client. This IP and port are sent out as part of the TCP payload. The NAT Gateway, which supports the ALG function updates the IP and port information in the packet contents, changes the Private IP and port of VM to the corresponding Public IP and port assigned by NAT gateway and build the mapping relationship, in this way, the FTP server on the Internet will actively connect and establish a data link according to the IP and port information provided in the packet after receiving this packet. Currently, JD Cloud & AI NAT Gateway supports ICMP ALG. |
| NAT Gateway Public IP | A Public IP is created and associated by default when creating NAT Gateway, the Public IP cannot be disassociated, cannot be deleted separately, and having the same life cycle with NAT Gateway Instance. Bandwidth cost corresponding to NAT Gateway Public IP is paid by configuration, same as the Elastic IP cost.|
