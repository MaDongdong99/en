## Multi-cloud Environment Interconnection

Scenario: Customers have deployed businesses on multiple public cloud platforms, and currently they need to open up different cloud environments via IPsec VPN so as to achieve resource and intranet interconnection among different cloud environments.

```
  Intranet segments in networking environments with multiple interconnections shall not conflict with each other and at least one static public IP shall be configured on VPN Gateway not belonging to JD Cloud (you are recommended to configure two static public IP).
```

For multi-cloud interconnection example, refer to [Connects to Amazon AWS](../../Best-Practices/Connection-Into-Amazon.md).

It is comparatively simple to interconnect with other cloud manufacturers and you can refer to the example of JD Cloud VPN Connecting to Enterprise IDC.
