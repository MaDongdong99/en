## Border Gateway
Border Gateway (BGW) is a gateway used by JD Cloud to carry VPC north-south traffic. Its main function is to realize Intranet interconnection with other external gateways or environments (such as enterprise IDC).

Current business scenarios realized by Border Gateway include:
  * Multiple VPCsâ€™ interconnection in the same region;
  * Interconnection between VPC and enterprise IDC/JD Cloud Cabinet Service through Direct Connect in the same region;
  * Interconnection between VPC and enterprise IDC/Office/Branch is achieved via VPN;

### Operation Steps
##### 1. Create border gateway
a) Log in [JD Cloud Border Gateway Console](https://cns-console.jdcloud.com/host/borderGateway/list);  </br>
b) Select regions for VPN usage and click **Create**;</br>
c) Enter border gateway name and create Border Gateway;</br>
d) The border gateway supports running BGP routing protocol. The BGP ASN of current JD Cloud border gateway is fixed to 65000, which will be open to modify in the future;</br>

##### 2. Modify Border Gateway
You can modify name, routing clauses, VPC attachment and transmission of border gateway.</br>
a) Log in [JD Cloud Border Gateway Console](https://cns-console.jdcloud.com/host/borderGateway/list);  </br>
b) Click corresponding border gateway and enter border gateway Details Page;</br>
d) The Details Page supports modifying border gateway name, configuring route table, and newly creating/editing VPC attachments, and the BGP ASN will be open to modify in the future;</br>
d) Configure border gateway route table, which supports two types of routes including static routes and BGP dynamic/transmission routes. Static route is statically configured in route table, while BGP dynamic/transmission route is learned from other BGP Peer devices by virtue of BGP Routing Protocol or transmitted through VPC attachments. Static route supports editing, while BGP dynamic route needs to modify published route at BGP Peer device. VPC transmission route will be updated by modifying transmission segment of VPC attachment. For more contents of Border Gateway Route Table configuration route transmission, refer to [VPC Attachment Operation Manual](VPC-Attachment-Configuration.md).;</br>
