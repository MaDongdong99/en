# Purchase Process
## Use Restrictions
In order to ensure the smooth creation of VPN resources, please carefully read the VPN Use Restrictions in details before purchasing. For details, please see [Use Restrictions](../Introduction/Restrictions.md).

## Preconditions
### Account Preparation

Before starting creating the VPN, you need to complete the registration of the JD Cloud & AI Account, Real-name Verification and the payment preparation for the purchase of resources.

### Account Registration

If you have already had a JD Cloud & AI account, you can skip the step and carry out subsequent settings.
If you have not registered a JD Cloud & AI account, you can conduct registration at JD Cloud & AI official website, please see [Registration of JD Cloud & AI](https://user.jdcloud.com/register).

### Account Verification

Real-name Verification is a prerequisite for the purchase and use of resources in JD Cloud & AI. You may choose personal real-name verification or enterprise real-name verification for the account. For details, please see [Real-name Verification](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/real-name-verification/introduction).

### Payment Preparation

If you purchase a VPN billed with pay by configuration/pay by consumption, since it is a pay-as-you-go mode, you should prevent your normal use of instances from impacting by failure of deduction of payment for resources due to insufficient account balance in the billing period. Therefore, to ensure your normal use, the sum of your account balance and available coupon will be no less than consumption threshold when you launch a VPN billed with pay by configuration/pay by consumption. At the same time, you can estimate the cost according to the selected resource configuration and associated resource configuration as well as the use time and then recharge it to guarantee sufficiency of cash balance and available coupon.

If you want to know more about billing rules, you can refer to [VPN Billing Rules](Billing-Overview.md).
