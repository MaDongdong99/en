- **Q: After associating an EIP to a resource, why the resource still cannot access the public network?**</br>
  A:  After resources in a VPC are associated to EIPs, you need to add a route rule to the public network in the route table of the subnet where the resources resides. The destination end is the public network segment (for example, all addresses: 0.0.0.0/0), both the next hop type and the address are Internet.  </br>
- **Q:When filling the source and destination IP addresses of the network ACL, what does the default value of 0.0.0.0/0 mean?**</br>
  A: 0.0.0.0/0 means to select all IP addresses. </br>
- **Q: What is the rule implementation order of the network ACL?**</br>
  A: Network ACL rules are matched according to the priority you set when created. The smaller number has the higher priority level;Once a rule matched, it will be immediately executed. If no rule been matched, the access will be denied. When two network ACL rules have the same priority, the rule matchs first will be executed. You are suggested do not set two network ACL rules with the same priority number, cause it may not be executed in the way you expect.
