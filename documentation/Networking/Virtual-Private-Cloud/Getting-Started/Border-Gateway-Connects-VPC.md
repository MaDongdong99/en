##  **Border gateway connects virtual private cloud**

**Business Scenarios**

In Region cn-north-1, two VPCs have communication requirements through private IPs, details as follows:

- First VPC

  - Name: VPCforBGWA
  - ID：vpc-xxvpcforbgwaxx
  - Range: 10.0.0.0/16

- Second VPC

  - Name: VPCforBGWB
  - ID：vpc-xxvpcforbgwbxx
  - Range: 192.168.0.0/16

**Step 1: Create border gateway**

1) Login console, click **Direct Connect Service** in the Network field of Product menu, then click **Border Gateway** in Direct Connect Service menu to access Border Gateway List page.

2) Click **Create** on Border Gateway List page to open Create Border Gateway Creation window.

3) Input gateway name in Border Gateway Creation window, click “OK” to complete the creation.Then, the List page will display the created Border Gateway. The configuration information is shown as follows:

- Region: cn-north-1
- Border Gateway Name: BGWA-B

**Step 2: Configure BGW route policies for VPC to be connected**

1) Click **Edit Route Policies** on the Border Gateway List page to edit route policy information

- Configure the next hop of route pointing to VPCforBGWA
- Configure the next hop of route pointing to VPCforBGWB

**Step 3: Create Route Table for Virtual Private Cloud to be connected**

1) Login console, click **Virtual Private Cloud** in the Network field of Product menu, then click **Route Table** on the Virtual Private Cloud menu to access Route Table List page.

2) Click **Create** on Route Table List page to open Route Table Create window.

3) Configure basic information of route table in Route Table Creation window, click “OK” to complete configuration. displaying : **Route policies to be configured after creating route table, and it will take effect by being associated with subnet. Configure now?**, select configure now to access Route Table Details page.

The configuration information of route table is shown as below:

- Region: cn-north-1
- Virtual Private Cloud: VPCforBGWA
- Name: RTBforBGWAtoB

4) Click “Route Policy” tab on Route Table Details page, then click “Edit” to enable route edit mode, click “Add a New One” for editing new route items.

5) Fill in relevant configuration in the route item, click to save and complete route table edit. Detailed configuration is shown as below:

- Fill in 192.168.0.0/16 as target end
- Select border gateway as next hop type
- Select BGWA-B as next hop
- If you need to access public network, you need to add 0.0.0.0/0 to route rule of Internet.

6) The configured route table shall be associated with subnets to be connected.

7) Use the same steps to create and configure route table RTBforBGWBtoA in the second VPC.

After completion of configuration, VPCs at both ends can establish connection through private IP. Similarly, multiple virtual private cloud in the same region can be connected through border gateway (support VPC Hub Function).
