# ** Business Security Access Control **

Scenario: Use a private network to deploy simple WEB services, such as websites and blogs. By configuring a virtual firewall such as a security group and a network ACL, the WEB service responds to client requests, but prevents the WEB service from accessing the internet and ensures the security of the WEB service.

Recommended Configuration: VPC, subnet, network ACL, security group, load balancer, VM, EIP
