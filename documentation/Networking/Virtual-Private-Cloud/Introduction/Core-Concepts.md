| :-----------: | :----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| VPC | Virtual Network | JD Public Cloud has a custom logically isolated network space similar to the traditional network built in data center. This VPC is fully controlled by users, supporting customized network segmentation and route policies. Users can create and manage multiple cloud products in VPC, such as VMs, load balancer, etc., and configure resources within the network to connect to the Internet. In addition, you can connect your IDC intranet and JD Cloud & AI network through dedicated Line connection/VPN access to enable composite cloud deployment of applications and smoothly migrate applications to the cloud. |
|    Subnet     |      Subnet      |  Subnet is an IP address block within the range of its VPC IP address.  Some cloud resources in VPC are deployed in subnets, such as VMs and load balancers. Subnet base is in VPC. After creating VPC, you can add subnets in the VPC. IP address blocks of subnets in the same VPC cannot overlap, and IP address blocks of subnets in different VPCs can overlap. The Subnet supports two types: Standard Subnet and Edge Subnet. |
|    Standard Subnet     |     Standard Subnet     | Subnet type, Standard Subnet doesn't associate with the edge zone, users can only create resources with central availability zones in Standard Subnet. |
|    Edge Subnet     |     Edge Subnet     | Subnet type, Edge Subnet can only associate with one independent edge zone, users can only create resources with associated independent edge zones in Edge Subnet. |
|      RTB      |    Route Table    |Route table is the set of a series of route rules and it is used to control the outward direction of the traffic from the subnets in VPC. JD Cloud & AI has two types of route tables: Default route table and customized route table. The route table automatically created when VPC is created is a default route table. The route table actively created by users is a customized route table. Each subnet must be associated with a route table and can only be associated with one route table. Each route table can be associated with multiple subnets. |
| ACL | Access Control List | Subnet-level stateless optional security layer is used for controlling data stream to and from subnet, which can be exact to protocol and port granularity, and act as a firewall to control traffic to and from one or more subnets. Without the protection of network ACL or the configuration of access control policy, all network ports of the servers in the subnet are more likely to be attacked or even invaded on the Internet. Network ACL can be used to filter the east-west traffic across subnets or the north-south traffic to and from the Internet. Subnets with the same network traffic control can be associated with the same network ACL. By setting the outbound and inbound permission rules, the traffic to and from the subnet can be precisely controlled. |
| Elastic IP | Elastic IP | Elastic EIP is an EIP address that can be independently applied. It can be dynamically bound and unbound with resources such as VMs, load balancers and NFV instances, Elastic IP supports two types: Standard Elastic IP and Edge Elastic IP. |
|  Standard Elastic IP   |  Standard Public IP | Standard Elastic IP is released in central availability zones in each region and can be associated with resources in central availability zones. |
|  Edge Elastic IP   |  Edge Elastic IP  | Edge Elastic IP, IP addresses are released in edge zones, so that end customers can conduct nearest access and the requirements of customers for high bandwidth and low latency are met |
| NFV Instance | NFV Instance | NFV is an abbreviation for Network Function Virtualization. NFV instance is a virtual network device with traditional network functions implemented by software technology and virtualization technology. E.g: VPN gateway, NAT gateway virtual host instance, etc. created by mirroring approach. |
| BGP | Border Gateway Protocol | BGP is an abbreviation for Border Gateway Protocol. Network operators declare IP address fields with each other through BGP protocol. BGP IP can implement single-IP multi-provider so as to achieve high-speed access for different network operators. |
| Region | Region | Different regions are different geographic regions. At present, JD Cloud & AI has four regions, namely cn-north-1, cn-south-1, cn-east-1 and cn-east-2. |
| Availability Zone | Availability Zone | AZ is an abbreviation for Availability Zone. A single region can contain multiple AZs, and resource isolation is achieved between different AZs to ensure high availability of resources. AZs in the same geographical region are usually interconnected with low-latency and high-bandwidth providers. |
| Tethered Edge Zone |    Edge Zone    | Tethered Edge Zone, EZ for short. JD Cloud & AI Tethered Edge Zone is a small and medium-size edge data center set and managed by JD Cloud & AI. |
| Tethered Independent Edge Zone |    Tethered Independent Edge Zone    | Tethered Independent Edge Zone is interconnected to central availability zones via VPN. The management channel between computing resources of Tethered Independent Edge Zone and computing resources of public cloud center region is connected while the data channel is isolated. |
| Tethered Express Edge Zone |    Tethered Express Edge Zone    | Tethered Express Edge Zone is interconnected to central availability zones via direct connection. The management channel and the data channel between computing resources of Tethered Express Edge Zone and computing resources of public cloud center region are both connected. |
| VPN Gateway | VPN Gateway | VPN is an abbreviation for Virtual Private Network. VPN gateway is a product based on Internet that securely interconnects enterprise data centers with VPCs on the cloud through encrypted tunnel. |
| NAT Gateway | NAT Gateway | NAT is an abbreviation for Network Address Translator. NAT gateway can provide users with enterprise-level VPC public network access services. |
| Load Balancer | Load Balancer | Load balancer can distribute traffic to multiple VMs, improve the external service capability of application system, and eliminate single point of failure. |
| BGW | Boundary Gateway | The south-north gateway of the data center docks the dedicated line to provide a virtual network interface for customer services. |
| Instance | Instance | Specifically refers to VMs and container resources.                                       |
