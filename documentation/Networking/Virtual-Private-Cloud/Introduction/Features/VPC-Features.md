## **VPC**

### Basic Concept

JD Virtual Private Cloud (hereinafter referred to as VPC) is the logically isolated cyberspace which you customize on the JD public Cloud. It is similar with the traditional network which you built in data center. This private cyberspace is completely controlled by the user and supports the customized division of the network segment and route policy, etc. Users can create and manage multiple cloud products in VPC, such as VMs, load balancer, etc., and configure resources within the network to connect to the Internet. In addition, you can get through your IDC intranet and JD VPC by VPN\Dedicated Line access, to realize hybrid cloud deployment of applications and enable the applications to migrate to the cloud smoothly.

JD Cloud VPC provides you with the following functions:

- Creating VPC and customizing the division of network segmentation, IP addresses and route policies, etc. can be realized through console and API
- Flexible access to the Internet can be realized through the manners of EIP and NAT Instance, etc.
- Subnet-level access control can be realized through network ACL.
- Instance-level access control can be realized through security group.

When creating the VPC, users can specify the range of IP address for VPC in the form of the classless inter-domain route block (CIDR, for example, 10.0.0.0/16) OR users can also choose not preset the CIDR (at this time, VPCâ€™s range will be changed dynamically according to the CIDR range of the subnet which is created in VPC). VPCs have the attributes of region. Users cannot create VPCs across the region. IP address blocks among different VPCs can overlap.



### IP Address of the VPC

You can realize the overall IP division of the VPC and subnet by specifying the CIDR (classless inter-domain route). In JD Cloud VPC, IP addresses which can be used by the users are divided into two categories:

- IP address of intranet, which is the IP address automatically assigned by the resources in VPC. The range shall be the address field of the VPC specified by RFC1918. Private IP address belongs to overlap IP. It can be used for the intercommunication between the resources in VPC and it cannot perform Internet communication directly.
- IP address of EIP, which can be independently applied by the user. It supports the dynamic associating and dissassociating with the resources. IP address of EIP is the only EIP address in the world and can be used for the communication between resources and the Internet.



### **CIDR**

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Route) is the independent address block in cyberspace specified by the user. The division for the address can be realized through the combination of prefix and mask. Take 10.1.0.0/16 as an example. If the 10.1.0.0 on the left side of the slash is prefix and the 16 on the right side of the slash is mask, the size of the network block can be adjusted by setting the size of the mask. The quantity of IP included by the network block of the VPC is 2^(32-mask), thus the 10.1.0.0/16 network block contains up to 65536 IP addresses.

Matters required attention when planning CIDR:

- When creating the VPC, it can choose that whether to specify the CIDR or not. If you have deep understanding of the network or are uncertain about the future development of the network, it is recommended to create the VPC without CIDR.
- CIDR of the subnet must be part of its VPC CIDR.
- The VPC currently supports the Private IP on three network segments: 10.a.0.0/16 (a belongs to 0 to 255), 172.b.0.0/16 (b belongs to 16 to 31) and 192.168.0.0/16.
- Currently, mask of the VPC and subnet CIDR support the value of 16-28.
