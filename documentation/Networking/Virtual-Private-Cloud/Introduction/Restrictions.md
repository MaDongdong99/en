# Use Restrictions

#### Related Restrictions of VPC and Subnet

- VPCs have attributes of region and do not support cross-regional deployment, such as across the regions of cn-east-2 and cn-north-1.
- CIDR’s network block cannot be modified after the subnet is created.
- VPCs do not support multicast or broadcast.
- VPC can contain multiple subnets. The network blocks of each subnet are the subset of the VPC’s CIDR. CIDR network blocks of multiple subnets cannot overlap.
- First address of the subnet CIDR is the network address; the last address is the broadcast address; the second and third IP addresses have been reserved by JD Cloud for network management. For example, the CIDR of the subnet is 10.1.0.0. /24. Wherein, 10.1.0.0 is the network address, 10.1.0.255 is the broadcast address AND 10.1.0.1 & 10.1.0.2 are reserved by JD Cloud, therefore the users cannot use them. Hence, the quantity of the available IPs of this subnet is 252.
- When the VM is added to a VPC, the system will randomly assign an available Private IP to the instance by default in specified subnet. Users can also specify the unallocated intranet IP in the selected subnet to perform allocation.



#### Related Restrictions of Route Table

- Each subnet must be associated with one route table and each route table can be associated with multiple subnets;
- The default route table and the customized route table which has been associated with the subnet cannot be deleted;
- Default Local route rules cannot be edited and deleted;
- Dynamic route protocols are not supported;



#### Related Restrictions of VPC Peering Connection:

- If you want to enable the real communication between the two ends of the peering connection, you must ensure that the relevant route rules are configured on the related route table of the local end and the opposite end.
- Currently, it only supports the VPC peering connection between the VPCs in the same region.
- VPC CIDR on both ends of the peering connection cannot overlap. If overlap is created, errors will be reported.
- Any Party of the peering connection can interrupt the peering connection at any time. The traffic between the two VPCs will be interrupted immediately after the interruption.
- There is no bandwidth upper limit for peering connection in the same region.
