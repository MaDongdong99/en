The model training platform relies on powerful distributed data processing capability and has built in rich algorithm models to satisfy the one-stop services from raw data to model output. At the same time, user can quickly build smart business in the model training platform by means of visual modeling of the drag-and-drop component.

**Benefits**

* 
Usability

The mode of visual drag-and-drop components is used for modeling experiment to integrate the sophisticated machine learning algorithms into algorithm components in any combination, so that only the simple adjustment of parameters is required to build the model, greatly reducing the user threshold.

* 
High Efficiency

In addition to high-performance CPU, the hardware GPU, FPGA and HPC are integrated for parallel acceleration, while the extreme speed experience is provided to you in combination with JD machine learning and big data computing power for many years.

* 
Modularization

It has a rich library of components, including logical regression (LR), clustering Kmeans, support vector machine (SVM), convolution neural network (CNN), depth neural network (DNN), collaborative filtering (CF) and other algorithm model components.

* 
One-stop

Set data import, data pre-processing, model training, model evaluation, model release and other functions are integrated in one, providing an one-stop all-round modeling process to help you quickly complete the modeling.
