# Compute resource

Based virtual technologies, the JD Cloud Swift platform builds computing resource pools, provides computing services and achieve unified scheduling and management on computing resources. Computing service refers to services such as creation, management and destruction to computing resources, mainly Virtual Machines and images.

With the unified self-service interface, application for computing resources is supported based on actual business demands of common users, stably and reliably carrying on upper applications. Full life cycle management on computing resources is also supported as the same time, improving utilization rate of computing resources.
