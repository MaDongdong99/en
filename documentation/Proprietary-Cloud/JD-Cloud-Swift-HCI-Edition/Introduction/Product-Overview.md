## Resolve Customer Scenarios

**Long Construction Period of Data Center** 

Traditional private cloud is time-consuming and has long period in respect of hardware purchase, hardware deployment and cloud platform deployment;

JD Cloud Swift HCI Edition provides mature solutions and is pre-installed with software before delivery and automatically configured, largely improving the efficiency.

**Scattered Platforms and Data**

Costs are increased and data information is scattered because each department uses cloud resources severally;

JD Cloud Swift HCI Edition intensively manages and controls all cloud resources by centralizing the data so as to make information sharing more convenient.

**High Costs for Continuous Operation and Maintenance and Slow Technical Upgrade**

Traditional private cloud has a high enterprise operation and maintenance threshold and the system upgrade is very slow;

With overall system operation and maintenance offered by JD Cloud, JD Cloud Swift HCI Edition keeps up with JD Cloud's technical developing route so that customers can focus on their businesses.
