# Floating IP

Floating IP is a public IP that can realize communication between the public and external network through NAT, and build floating IP pools provided by users. Users can separately manage their own floating IPs, and the floating IPs can flexibly associate with resources that need to communicate with the external network, such as Virtual Machines and Load Balancer. After completely used, they can be disassociated at any time.
