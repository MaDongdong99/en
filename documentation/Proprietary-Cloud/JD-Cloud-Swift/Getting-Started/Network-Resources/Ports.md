# Elastic Network Interface

Elastic network interface is a virtual network interface inside of subnet. When creating a VM instance, the platform will choose a subnet and automatically assign an Elastic Network Interface inside of the subnet; meanwhile, the platform also supports users to directly create an Elastic Network Interface and associate it to the selected Virtual Machine. A plurality of elastic network interfaces can be associated on one virtual machine resource so as to expand multiple ports to be connected with different subnets and meet different business requirements.
