# Cloud Disk Snapshot

The platform supports users in replication of data in Cloud Disk Service by snapshot method, guaranteeing that data are rapidly recovered in case of faults. Snapshot is a full copy of Cloud Disk Service, including the data image of the disk from creation time point to backup time point, to store it in a redundant manner.

One or more Virtual Machines with the same configuration as the current Virtual Machine can be quickly replicated based on Virtual Machine image and Cloud Disk Snapshot, so as to realize quick bulk deployment of businesses.
