# Benefits

## Open and Compatible, and Continuous Evolution

The underlayer of platform is compatible with x86-Intel V4, V5 and V6, x86-Hygon architecture, and supports CPU hardware virtualized devices, and can connect a variety of storage devices; and the upper layer of platform can host a variety of enterprise-level applications. Decouple the software and hardware through software defined hardware, so that the software can be evolved, the hardware can be updated, and the supporting system can continuously evolve.

## Self-development, Independence and Controllability of Software

Based on the advanced open source technology architecture, the underlayer cloud platform is independently developed to solve some important and difficult problems, such as the instability of open source solutions in large-scale and commercial scenarios, so that the platform is independent, controllable and trustworthy.

## Complete Product Chain Services

Based on the independently developed IaaS layer service and unified cloud management platform, it can integrate JD Group and third party PaaS, SaaS services, and build a complete ISV cooperative ecology. At the same time, full life cycle services, such as consultation, deployment, operation and maintenance as well as prime service, are provided based on JD Cloud’s rich experience in technical practices to greatly increase service richness and provide users with maximum value.

## Stable Platform, Reliable Data and Perfect Performance

Distributed architecture is adopted for the cluster, to support high availability, disaster recovery and automatic fault correction, with the service availability of 99.95%. The multi-replica storage mechanism is adopted to ensure that the data reliability reaches 99.99999%. The 3-node cluster supports the running of more than 200 virtual machines in the upper layer, and the IOPS for each 10 servers can be up to a million.

## Quick Deployment, Smooth Upgrade and Autonomous Expansion

The installation and deployment based on bare machine can be completed within one day by one person. The underlayer cloud platform supports smooth and nonperceptive upgrade of the control plane; supports elastic thermal expansion of cluster. The users are not aware of upgrade and expansion process, guaranteeing that the business is not interrupted.

## Full Stack Security

Backed by JD Cloud Trusted Cloud Service Certification, ISO27001 Security Certification as well as other national and international authoritative security certification, it provides users’ own data centers with deep security defense at physical level, network level, machine level, virtualization level, application level and data level so as to guarantee business and data security of users.

## Consistent Experience

Support the integration with the existing enterprise basic IT platform and supports the high-performance Hybrid Cloud computing scheme. Users can use heterogeneous computing resources to better match the features of enterprise-level business applications and quickly deploy business systems, so as to obtain a consistent JD Cloud Onboarding experience.
