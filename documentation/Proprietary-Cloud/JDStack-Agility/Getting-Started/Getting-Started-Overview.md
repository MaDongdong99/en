# Getting Started Overview

There are three permissions (user self-service, background management, operation and maintenance management) that can be set on the JDStack platform where users can be granted from one to three permissions. Common users of the platform are given self-service permission by background administrator. After logging in the platform as an ordinary user, you are suggested to create a Virtual Machine to quickly get familiar with the platform environment by the following way.

The specific steps to create a Virtual Machine that can access Internet are as follows:

Step 1, create a network and subnet

Step 2, create a route

Step 3, connect route to subnet

Step 4, route sets gateway

Step 5, create VM

Step 7, assign floating IP

Step 8, associate floating IP for Virtual Machines
