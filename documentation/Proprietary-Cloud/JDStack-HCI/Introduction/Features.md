## Software Definition Calculation, Network and Storage for Hyper-converged and Hybrid Deployment

### Virtual Resource Service

Compared with traditional hyper-converged products, JDStack HCI has more powerful SDN (Software Definition Network) function. Provide virtual services, such as software definition calculation, storage and network, for hyper-converged and hybrid deployment, support self-service access to cloud management platform and application for IT resources on demand by users, easily use virtual resources such as Virtual Machines, Cloud Disk Service, VPC, Load Balancer and others, with 3 nodes supporting operation of more than 200 Virtual Machines.



## Integrated and Unified Resource Management Platform

### Multi-tenant Unified Management

Support user to make unified identity authorization to multiple levels and multiple tenants via the cloud management platform. At most 4 tenant levels can be created, effectively improving platform operation efficiency.

### Unified Resource Management

Support integration management for physical resources and virtual resources of the entire cluster via the cloud management platform, support the hierarchical resource quota management by users and make virtual resource management accurate to core.



## Integrated Monitoring, Operation and Maintenance Platform

### Monitoring Cabinet Visualization Screen of All-in-one Machine

For complete machine delivery, visual information such as core monitoring of all-in-one machine can be exhibited via the visualization screen of cabinet. Service conditions of CPU, memory and disks in all-in-one machine, creation number of virtual machines as well as service statuses of calculation, network, storage and database can be conveniently browsed.

### Visual Operation, Maintenance and Monitoring of Cloud Management Platform

The cloud management platform provides all-around visual monitoring from hardware facility to cloud platform, and realizes multi-dimensional monitoring and alarm to resource survival, utilization rate and performance from points of views such as physical level, management level and virtual level, effectively promoting operation and maintenance efficiency.



## Integrated Application
