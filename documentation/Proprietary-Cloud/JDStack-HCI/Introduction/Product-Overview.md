## Resolve Customer Scenarios

**Long Construction Period of Data Center** 

Traditional private cloud is time-consuming and has long period in respect of hardware purchase, hardware deployment and cloud platform deployment;

JDStack HCI provides mature solutions and is pre-installed with software before delivery and automatically configured, largely improving the efficiency.

**Scattered Platforms and Data**

Costs are increased and data information is scattered because each department uses cloud resources severally;

JDStack HCI intensively manages and controls all cloud resources by centralizing the data so as to make information sharing more convenient.

**High Costs for Continuous Operation and Maintenance and Slow Technical Upgrade**

Traditional private cloud has a high enterprise operation and maintenance threshold and the system upgrade is very slow;

With overall system operation and maintenance offered by JD Cloud, JDStack HCI keeps up with JD Cloud's technical developing route so that customers can focus on their businesses.
