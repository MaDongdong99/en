## **IV. How We Protect and Save Your Personal Information**

​        (I) Our technology and measures to protect your personal information

​         We value personal information security and take all reasonable and practicable steps to protect your personal information:

​         1. Technical Measures for Data Security

​         We will adopt safety protection measures in line with industry standards, including establishing reasonable regulations and safety technologies to prevent your personal information from being accessed, used or modified without authorization and avoid data damage or loss.

​         JD's network service adopts encryption technologies such as the transport layer security protocol, and provides browsing services through https and with other methods to ensure the security of user data in the transmission process.

​         JD uses encryption technologies to encrypt and save users' personal information and isolate it through the isolation technology.

​         In the use of personal information, such as personal information display and personal information correlation calculation, we will use a variety of data desensitization technologies including content replacement and SHA256 to enhance the security of personal information in use.

​         JD uses strict data access authority control and multiple identity authentication technologies to protect personal information and prevent data from being used in violation.          JD uses automatic code security inspection and data access log analysis technology to conduct personal information security audit.

​         2. Other Security Measures Taken by JD to Protect Personal Information

​         JD manages and regulates the storage and use of personal information by establishing data classification and grading systems, data security management specifications, and data security development specifications.

​         JD conducts comprehensive security control of data through information contact confidentiality agreements, monitoring and auditing mechanisms.

​         JD has established a data security committee and set up a full-time department for information protection and a data security emergency response organization to promote and protect the personal information security.

​         Security certification and services. The underlying cloud technology that we use to store your personal data has obtained the level 3 certification of  "Trusted cloud" certification issued by the Data Center Alliance, passed the level 3 certification of the Ministry of Public Security's security level protection, and also obtained the ISO27000 certification.

​         Strengthen safety awareness. We will also organize security and privacy protection training courses to enhance employees' awareness of the importance of protecting personal information.

​         3. We only allow employees and partners of JD and its affiliates who need to know such information to access personal information, and set up strict access authority control and monitoring mechanisms for this purpose.

Failure to comply with these obligations may result in legal liability being pursued or suspension of the partnership with JD.

​         4. We will take all reasonable and feasible measures to ensure that no irrelevant personal information is collected. We will only retain your personal information for the duration required for the purposes stated in the Policy, unless the retention period requires to be extended, or permitted by law.

​         5. We've also done some creative work on user data protection

​         In the delivery system of JD, a unique "smile-face order" is adopted to avoid the exposure of users' sensitive data in the delivery link; meanwhile, we have vigorously strengthened data security training and requirements for JD logistics staff to raise their awareness of protecting users' private data.

​         6. The Internet is not an absolutely secure environment, and it can't be determined whether the Email, instant messaging, social software and other ways of communicating with other users are fully encrypted. We recommend that you use complex passwords when using such tools, and pay attention to protecting your personal information.

​         7. The Internet environment is not 100% secure and we will do our best to ensure or guarantee the security of any information you send us.
