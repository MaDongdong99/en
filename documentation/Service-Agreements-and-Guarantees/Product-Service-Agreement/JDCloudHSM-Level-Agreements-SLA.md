### **1. Service Scope**

 JDCloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware encryption machine that can allow users to easily encrypt and decrypt application data on the cloud. By use of JD Cloud & AI HSM, users can manage your own keys using an encryption machine that has been authenticated by the State Encryption Administration and protect data privacy and regulatory compliance requirements by selecting domestic cryptographic algorithms and most of the international common cryptographic algorithms on demand.

### **2. Service Level Indicator**

#### **2.1 Data Persistence**

Data persistence: no lower than 99.9999999%

Data persistence is counted by service cycle, a service cycle is a natural month, if it is less than a month, then it is not counted as a service cycle.

The data durability calculation formula is as follows: instance of complete data per service cycle/(instance of complete data per service period + instance of lost data per service period).

Namely, the no data loss probability per 1,000,000,000 JD Cloud & AI HSM instances in normal use per month is 99.9999999%, which means at most 1 JD Cloud & AI HSM instance may have data loss per month.

#### **2.2 Destruction Nature of Data**

2.2.1 If users delete instances of their own accord or need to destruct instances after the expiry of the user service term, JD Cloud & AI will automatically initialize the JD Cloud & AI HSM instance and the data cannot be recovered.

2.2.2 Before scrapping, outsourced maintenance or resale of the encryption devices used for the cloud services, JD Cloud & AI will adopt demagnetization operation on its physical disk.

#### **2.3 Migration Nature of Data**

Users can use the methods provided by JD Cloud & AI to conduct encrypted export, encrypted import, encrypted backup and other operations for key pair when the JD Cloud & AI HSM instance is normally run.

#### **2.4 Privacy of Data**

JD Cloud & AI HSM is implemented by the hardware security module and users are entitled to the ownership of this instance; users can completely and independently conduct initialization, authorization, key pair import, key pair export, key pair backup and other management operations for this JD Cloud & AI HSM instance.

#### **2.5 Service Functions**

The JD Cloud & AI HSM instance is provided by the cloud encryption device certified by the State Cryptography Administration, whose functions are consistent with the physical encryption device.

JD Cloud & AI provides maintenance, repair, fault recovery and other services for the physical encryption device.

#### **2.6 Service Availability**

Service availability: not less than 99.9%.

The availability shall be counted according to the service cycle, specifying that one natural month shall be one service cycle; in case of less than one month, it shall not be counted as one service cycle.

Unavailable time: Only JD Cloud & AI HSM instances are unavailable for successive 5 minutes or above can be regarded as unavailable time. If the unavailable service time is less than 5 minutes, it does not account for unavailable time. The JD Cloud & AI HSM instance service unavailable time shall exclude daily system maintenance time and unavailable time due to user reasons, the third party reasons or force majeure.

#### **2.7 Fault Recovery Capability**

JD Cloud & AI provides 7×24 hours of operation maintenance for paying users, and provides technical support by means of telephone fault reporting, and has a series of fault incident response mechanisms such as fault monitoring, automatic alarm, fast positioning, fast recovery, etc.

#### **2.8 Service Compensation Terms**

##### **2.8.1 Compensation Scope:**

In the event of failure of normal use of JD Cloud & AI HSM instances due to JD Cloud & AI fault, JD Cloud & AI will compensate for the unavailable time, excluding the service unavailability time caused by the following reasons:

(1) Caused by the system maintenance that JD Cloud & AI has notified the users in advance, including migration, maintenance, upgrade and simulation fault drill;

(2) Unavailability situations such as packet loss and latency caused by operator fault;

(3) Caused by hacker attacks to the user’s application program or data information;

(4) Caused by loss or leakage of data, passwords, etc. due to user’s improper maintenance or improper confidentiality;

(5) Caused by user’s own upgrading of operating system;

(6) Caused by user’s application program or installation activities;

(7) Caused by user’s negligence or operations authorized by the user;

(8) Caused by force majeure and accidents;

(9) Other unavailability caused not due to JD Cloud & AI’s account.

##### **2.8.2 Compensation Scheme**

Fault Time = Unavailable Time.

For the JD Cloud & AI HSM by monthly package, compensation shall be made by the means of compensating service duration at 100 times of fault time/single instance. 

 

### **3. Others**

JD Cloud & AI has the right to make adjustments to some service indicators of the Service Level Agreement according to changes, and promptly publish announcements on JD Cloud & AI official website ([www.jdcloud.com](https://www.jdcloud.com/)), or send emails or written notices to notify the users of the modified contents.
