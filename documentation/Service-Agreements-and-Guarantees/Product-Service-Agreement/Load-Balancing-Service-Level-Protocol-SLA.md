**1. Service Scope**

The load balancer provided by JD Cloud is a service that distributes traffic to multiple cloud servers. Load balancer extends the external service capability of the application system through traffic distribution and improves the availability of the application system by eliminating single point of fault.

## **2. Service Level Indicators**

### **2.1 Service Features**

The load balancer has advanced features such as self-service management, automatic fault recovery, and anti-network attacks. The load balancer is suitable for community sites, corporate websites, portals, e-commerce sites, SAAS apps, and gaming apps. For details on all the specific functions of the load balancer service, please refer to the detailed description documentation, technical documentation and help documentation provided by JD Cloud on the official website. All functional changes to the load balancer that may affect the user will be announced to the user.

**2.2 Service Availability**

Service Availability: No less than 99.9% of single instance.

Calculation Formula for Service Availability: Actual availability of the instance = (total time-actual unavailable time) / total time × 100%

Among them, the actual unavailable time = unavailable time × reduction ratio of user's business traffic, which applies to the VIP of 4/7 layer as well.

Instructions:

1) Calculate the actual availability of the instance in month.

**2.7 Services Compensation Terms**

The load balancer service of JD Cloud follows the principle of compensation for faults by 100 times.

**2.7.1** **Compensation Scope**

For the inability of the load balancer to work properly caused by JD Cloud fault, and the inability of normal access to the website caused by JD Cloud fault, JD Cloud will compensate for the unavailable time. However, the service unavailable time caused by the following reasons is not included:

1) Caused by the system maintenance procedures after JD Cloud's notification in advance, including cutting, maintenance, upgrading and simulated fault drill;

2) Packet loss and delay caused by operators' fault;

3) Hackers' hacking to the users' application programs or data information;

4) The loss or leakage of data, key, passwords, etc. due to user's improper maintenance or improper confidentiality measures;

5) Caused by the user upgrading the operating system by himself;

6) Caused by the user's application or installation activities;

7) Caused by user's negligence or operation authorized by the user;

8) Caused by force majeure or accidents;

9) Unavailability caused by other reasons not related to JD Cloud.

**2.7.2** **Compensation Plan**

Fault time = actual unavailable time.

Load balancer in monthly package is compensated in the way of service time compensation, i.e. 100 times/set of the fault time.

Load balancer paid by configuration is compensated in the form of coupon, the payout amount of a single case = the average hourly cost in the 24 hours before the fault/ 60 × fault time × 100.

Instructions:

If the use time of the load balancer is paid by configuration is less than 24 hours, the cost shall be calculated based on the average of actual use time, the fault time shall be calculated by minutes;

Total amount of compensation shall not exceed the total amount of cash paid for the current service of a single set of load balancer;

Load balancer only compensates the load balancer itself, and does not compensate for the virtual machine under the load balancer.
