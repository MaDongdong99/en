**1. Service Scope**

Native container is the newly released innovative container product based on JD Cloud's deep accumulation in container technology. The product fully combines the advantages of containers and virtual machines, without managing servers or clusters, creating a secure, easy-to-use native container for users and billing in flexible way to effectively reduce user input costs.

**2. Service Level Indicators**

**2.1 Service Features**

Native containers have advanced features such as self-service management, data security guarantee, automatic fault recovery, and anti-network attacks. Native containers are suitable for community sites, corporate websites, portals, e-commerce sites, SAAS apps, and gaming apps. For details on all the specific functions of the native container, please refer to the specifications documentation, technical documentation and help documentation provided by JD Cloud on its official website. All functional changes to the native container that may affect the user will be announced to the user.

**2.2 Service Availability**

Service Availability: No less than 99.95%.

The native container availability calculation formula: All available time per container per service period/(all available time per container per service period + all unavailable time per container per service period). 

Wherein:

(1) The availability of the native container is counted according to the service period. One service period is a natural month. If it is less than one month, it is not counted as one service period. The statistical business unit is a single container, and the time unit is minute.

(2) Unavailable Time: The time when the service provided by the native container is not available for 5 minutes or more, and if the service is unavailable for less than 5 minutes, it is not counted into unavailable time. The unavailability time of native container does not include daily system maintenance time, and the unavailability time due to user reasons, third-party causes, or force majeure.

**2.3 Service Resource Allocation Capability**

The native container provides multiple configurations and has elastic scalability. Users can expand or reduce the container resources used online according to the JD Cloud's configuration plan.

**2.4 Fault Recovery Capability**

JD Cloud provides 7×24h operation and maintenance for the container instances of paying users, and provides technical support by means of telephone reporting, and has a series of fault emergency response mechanisms such as fault monitoring, automatic alarm, rapid positioning and fast recovery.

**2.5 Network Access Performance**

When setting up the JD Cloud's native container, the user can select the EIP outlet bandwidth required for each container. The EIP outlet bandwidth can be configured from 1Mbps to 200Mbps. JD Cloud adopts BGP multi-line access to ensure the quality of network access for users.

**2.6 Service Measurement Accuracy**

The native container has an accurate and transparent metering and billing system. The native container settles and charges in real time according to the actual usage of the user's native container, and the specific billing standard is subject to the effective billing mode and price announced on the official website of JD Cloud. The user's original billing log is reserved for a minimum of 3 years by default for future reference.

**2.7 Data Persistence**

Data Persistence: Not less than 99.9999999% 

Data persistence is counted by service period. One service period is a natural month. If it is less than one month, it is not counted as one service period.

The data durability calculation formula is as follows: Container Cloud Disk Service of complete data per service period/(Container Cloud Disk Service of complete data per service period+container cloud disk of lost data per service period). I.e. the no data loss probability per 1,000,000,000 Container Cloud Disk Service is 99.9999999%. This means that at most 1 Container Cloud Disk Service may have the data loss per month.

**2.8. Data Destructibility**

2.8.1 If the user deletes the data or needs to destroy the data after the service expires, JD Cloud will automatically clear the disk and memory data on the corresponding physical server, so that the data cannot be recovered.

2.8.2 Before the equipment used in the cloud service is scrapped, disposed, repaired by outsourcing or resold, JD Cloud will degauss its physical disk.

**2.9. Data Migration**

When the user enables the container, JD Cloud provides a snapshot recovery method, so that the user can quickly deploy the environment and import data; when the user stops using the container, the data can be migrated out through the network.

**2.10. Data Privacy**

JD Cloud uses encryption, tenant isolation, security group isolation and other means to ensure that user data in the same resource pool is mutually invisible. The security group isolates different user resources through a series of identity and access management technologies such as data link layer and network layer.

**2.11. Right to Know about Data**

2.11.1. The user has the right to know the data, the geographical location of the data center where the backup data is located, and the number of data backups, among which:

2.11.1.1 At present, JD Cloud data centers are distributed in North China (Beijing), East China (Suqian), East China (Shanghai) and South China (Guangzhou).
