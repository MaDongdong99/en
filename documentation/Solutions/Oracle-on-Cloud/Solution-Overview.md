# Overview of cloud solutions on Oracle
JD Cloud released the Oracle access solution to assist digital transformation of enterprise, provide stable, high-efficiency and safe platform support for cloud access of the enterpriseâ€™s Oracle business system. The users can, after obtaining Oracle authorization by themselves, deploy various architectures based on Oracle database on JD Cloud.

## Features of the Solutions
- **Support for multiple deployment architectures:** Deployment implementing multiple architectures such as Oracle disaster recovery through ADG is supported, including Oracle RAC and Oracle HA
- **Multiple mechanisms to ensure data reliability:** High-efficiency SSD cloud disk uses the three-copy mechanism, which may protect the reliability of user data to the most extent in combination with snapshot feature
- **Perfect data backup:** Data may be backed up to the cloud disks through RMAN and then uploaded to the object storage service; and may also use the snapshot feature of cloud disk to create snapshots regularly
- **Flexible network deployment:** VPC supports user customized network deployment, and the elastic network interface may support multiple IPs, to meet the network deployment demands for several complicated scenarios

## Key Points
### 1. Shared Storage
Multi-point attachment function of JD cloud disk can achieve "shared storage" of disk. A single cloud disk can be attached on multiple virtual machines at the same time, and each instance can be used for reading/writing data from/in any area of such cloud disk. About multi-point fault function of the cloud disk, you can refer to the [Cloud Disk Service Help Documentation](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/cloud-disk-service/multiattachdisk)
### 2. Network Multicast
Considering the stability and security of the network, JD Cloud does not support network multicast. We can use the software from a third party to achieve the multicast function required for Oracle RAC; refer to the document that follows for details.
