# **Application Scenario**

**Page and Image Acceleration**

Web service is the most basic way to host Internet business content. Page and image acceleration is the static content distribution of websites or applications, such as various types of image files, html files, flash animations, css, javascript files, and so on. It is applicable to a variety of portals, E-commerce websites, news and information sites or applications, government/enterprise official sites, and entertainment game sites or applications.

Web page loading speed is the key indicator that affects the user experience. According to Gomez statistics, if the page loading time exceeds 7 seconds, 50% users will choose to give up, and each 1 second latency will lead to 7% decrease in conversion rate. The predecessor of JD Cloud CDN is the self-built CDN platform that serves JD Mall. After years of the challenge of big promotion business activities such as 618 and double 11, for pages, images and other small files, it has multiple optimization technologies in terms of cache hit, content compression, refresh processing, etc., having realized opening the home page in one second, and opening images is as fast as they are opened locally.

**Large File Download Acceleration**

It refers to static large file distribution of websites or applications, such as game installation package apk files, application update files rar, patch program files, audio and video files and other relatively larger files. The large file acceleration business is applicable to downloading sites and audio and video applications.

Large file downloading is a business that consumes a lot of network bandwidth and occupies a large proportion of the operating cost of the website. Distributing files to the edge node closest to the netizens through CDN can greatly improve the user experience of the netizens and download the file content to local in less time; on the other hand, the bandwidth cost of the origin server can be well controlled, especially for those business scenarios where the content update frequency is not high, the bandwidth usage of the origin server can almost be reduced to the minimum. File acceleration effect and cost control depend on the link quality, storage capacity, scheduling mechanism, back-to-origin mechanism and prewarm capability of the CDN node.

JD Cloud CDN selects the high-quality infrastructure of the whole network, with the edge nodes covering the whole network and the whole region, actually realizing being closest to the netizens, the upper layer nodes directly connected to the backbone networks of all the major operators, and having stable, reliable and topspeed transmission link guarantee; the storage capacity and bandwidth capacity of all nodes are sufficient; low-latency, high-hit ratio, fast distribution and minimum back-to-origin are simultaneously realized through intelligent scheduling, three-level cache, NVMe, and real-time computing of hot-spot content to optimize the user experience and minimize the operating cost of the website.

**VOD Acceleration**

It refers to various video and audio sites, such as film and television video sites, online education video sites, news video sites, short video social network sites, and relevant audio sites and applications.

The acceleration principle of VOD business is similar to the file distribution. The differences are that the VOD business has stricter requirements on the connection time, transmission speed and stability. These indicators will directly affect whether the on-demand content can start playing immediately, whether the playing process is smooth, and whether there are bad user experiences such as buffering and slow running.

JD Cloud CDN monitors the service quality of video services in real time through an all-dimensional stereoscopic monitoring system, and conduct dynamical optimization in real time to realize a 98% fluency of VOD service.

**Live Video Acceleration**

The business provides high-performance and stable live streaming technology platform services for various live video platforms, such as interactive online education websites, game sports live streaming sites, personal show live streaming, event and vertical industry live streaming platforms. Currently, the three formats RTMP, HLS, and FLV are supported for live streaming content acceleration. 

The acceleration of live video service is slightly different from the traditional CDN acceleration principle. For the acceleration of streaming data, both the pushing streaming capability and the pulling streaming capability shall be considered. 600+ nodes of JD Cloud widely cover all regions and operators across nationwide, which implement nearby access to the stream, pushing streaming, as well as high-quality experience of high availability, low latency.
