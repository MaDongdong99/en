- referer blacklist: It does not allow access of the rule-compliant request; referer white list: allows access of the rule-compliant request
- Allows direct access to the resource URL through the browser: Whether to allow request access without the referer field (it currently only supports no referer field and the follow-up support of scenarios where the referer field is blank)
- Only one of the referer black and white list configurations can take effect. When the white list is selected, the rule and the â€œAllow the direct sample resource URL through the browser" cannot be both blank
- Support multiple referer configurations, up to 50, and cannot be repeated
- Support extensive domain name rule configuration
