# Protocol following back-to-origin

After configuring protocol following back-to-origin, the protocol used by the back-to-origin server is the same as the protocol of the netizen resource request. When the netizen requests the resource using the http protocol, the CDN back-to-origin server uses http protocol to the resource; when the netizen requests the resource using the https protocol, the CDN back-to-origin server uses https protocol to the resource.
