**Shared Cache**

Applicable to the cache policy that multiple domain names share one primary domain names; you can add these domain names into a group and enable shared cache function, namely the domain names in the group will share the same cache policy, and reduce back-to-source thereby. For example, the domain name a.com and b.com share the cache policy of a.com; after setting the shared cache, when the user requests b.com, the cache policy of a.com will be returned.

- The extensive domain name, i.e. *.a.com, can also share the cache if it is not used for setting up the domain group. The shared cache configuration can be independently opened in "[Cache Configuration](https://cdn-console.jdcloud.com/detail/cache?id=wshtest.jcloud.com)", i.e. all sub-domains under *.a.com can request the cache policy under *.a.com, and extensive domain name can also share the cache with other domains when setting up the domain group as an independent one.
