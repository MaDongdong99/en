# Product Performance

The Cloud File Service consists of general and capacity types. Their performance indexes are listed in the table as below:

| Specification   | Characteristics                                                         | Performance Formula                                                     | Applicable Scenario                                                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| General | Flexible capacity expansion and pay by actual usage; <br />linear growth between throughput bandwidth performance and capacity; <br />millisecond-level delay and a maximum of tens of GB/s total throughput bandwidth; <br />stable high-throughput, low-delay performance for sequential and random read/write scenarios. | **Throughput Bandwidth:** Capacity increase of 0.1MB/s per GB with a basic speed limit of 50MB/s; you may open a ticket to increase the bandwidth throughput. <br /> **Delay:** 2ms (4KB IO size, same as AZ environment). | Scenarios where the shared file service has high requirements for delay and total bandwidth throughput, such as AI training, image & video rendering, etc. |
| Capacity | Flexible capacity expansion and pay by actual usage; <br />linear growth between throughput bandwidth performance and capacity; <br />millisecond-level delay and a maximum of tens of GB/s total throughput bandwidth; <br />in non-frequent write scenarios, the sequential read/write can provide throughput and delay performance equivalent to the General but requiring lower costs. | Not Applicable                                                       |File sharing, backup and filing scenarios requiring low cost and big capacity.               |
