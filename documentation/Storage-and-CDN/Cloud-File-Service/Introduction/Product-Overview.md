# Product Overview

JD Cloud File Service (hereinafter referred to as CFS) is a fully-hosted distributed file system with high reliability, expandability and sharable access. It adopts NFS protocol, which supports POSIX file API and provides shared file services for Virtual Machines under Linux and Windows.
Compared to Cloud Disk Service (block storage), CFS provides GB level throughput bandwidth and is applicable to sharing of multiple computing nodes. At the same time, because CFS passes more protocol conversion and routes, the IO delay is a number of millisecond, higher than that of Cloud Disk Service (block storage), and has a performance weaker than Cloud Disk Service (block storage) in read/write scenarios that have requirements for less IO and higher delay performance.
Compared to Object Storage Service (OSS), CFS can provide files with local data update and write for Append, which is more applicable to scenarios of write many read many; at the same time, the application system can use the semantics applied for local file system to operate the CFS and migrate the local application on cloud, which is more friendly to scenarios with a higher requirement for throughput bandwidth of storage.
CFS can be expanded or reduced as needed based on the actual usage of CFS without interrupting the application service, and billed according to average usage per hour to benefit the cost control of storage under big data bulk.
