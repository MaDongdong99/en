On the file storage list page, you can see all the created file storage under the current login account. File storage distinguishes between "regions", so you can switch between different regions and view the file storage created under that region by clicking **Region** at the top of the list page. During the public Beta period, only the “cn-south-1” region will be open.

 

At the top right of the file storage list, the file storage can be searched by the ID or name of the file storage. Among them, searching by "ID" is "exact” search, the keyword must match the ID of the file store exactly; searching by "name" is "fuzzy" search, as long as the keyword is included in the file storage name, it meets the search criteria.

 

The contents of the file storage list are arranged in reverse order of “creation time”. You can view the “details information” of the File storage by clicking the **ID** of the File Storage; or click **Manage File Storage Access** on the right side of each file storage to manage the attached target of the File Storage, or click **Delete File Storage** to delete the File storage.
