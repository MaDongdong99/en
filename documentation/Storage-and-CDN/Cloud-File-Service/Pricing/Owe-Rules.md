# **Resource Arrear Handling Rule**

If the available balance of your account (including cash balance and available coupon) are insufficient to pay off issued bill of Cloud File Service, the Cloud File Service will be changed to the arrear status.

After your Cloud File Service is in arrear, JD Cloud will send an email and SMS to your account contact person, informing that your resources are in arrears. Please be sure to check out the notice and recharge in time, for avoidance of unnecessary loss; read and write to file storage in Cloud File Service will not be affected within 24 hours after arrear; and JD Cloud will continuously deduct your account as per your file storage consumption, with the arrear amount accumulated.

If your Cloud File Service is in arrear for more than 24 hours, Cloud File Service under your account will be unavailable for service. In such case, the file storage cannot be normally read and written, but data in the file storage will be still kept.

If your Cloud File Service is in arrear for more than 7 days, you will receive a resource release notice about Cloud File Service. When the resource is released, data in your file storage cannot be retrieved. Please be sure to pay attention to the resource arrear status and renew in time, to avoid loss of key data.

You can pay the arrear bills from the arrear moment of Cloud File Service to the moment of resource release. Once all arrear bills are paid off, your Cloud File Service will be recovered to normal use and the accumulative arrear time will be cleared.

You can save the cost of Cloud File Service by deleting unnecessary data in time.
