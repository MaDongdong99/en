During the public Beta period, users can apply for the “[Cloud File Service](https://www.jdcloud.com/public/testApply/zfs)” Beta trial through JD Cloud official website or here. We will start the review process as soon as we receive the application, and enable a Cloud File Service trial within 4 working days or feedback the results of the review.

Cloud File Service is free during the Beta period. After the product is officially released, it will be billed according to the actual usage of the File Storage.
