# Put Bucket Lifecycle

## Description

JD Cloud Object Storage Service supports object Lifecycle management function through Bucket rule setting. Expired Objects can be automatically deleted to facilitate maintenance and reduce cost during the use of Bucket. If users manually maintain the life cycle of data, it will take a lot of time and energy; but the failure of maintenance will lead to high cost. The life cycle management can help users automatically complete data life cycle management, realize automatic process of data deletion, and save manpower and money cost.

The operation can set the life cycle rule and substitute the current rule for specified Bucket. **Deletion of expired resources is irreversible. Please configure file life cycle time plan reasonably based on your demands.**
