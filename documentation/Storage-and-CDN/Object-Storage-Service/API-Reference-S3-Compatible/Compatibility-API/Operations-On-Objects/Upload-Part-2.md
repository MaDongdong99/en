# Upload Part

## Description
Upload single multipart in the Multipart Upload. You must initial a new multipart upload event. In the initialization request, OSS will return Upload ID that is regarded as the unique identifier, and your multipart upload request needs to contain the ID.

The number of multiparts is any number from 1 to 10,000, multipart number is the unique identifier of a multipart and also is the location identifier of the multipart in the whole Object.

In order to ensure that the data are not corrupted in transmission, you can specify Content-MD5 in the multipart upload request, and OSS will check multipart data according to the MD5 value. In case of mismatching, it will return an error.

Note: After initialing multipart upload and uploading one or multiple multiparts, OSS will charge the bucket occupied by the multipart by volume, and you must complete or terminate multipart upload to stop storage cost of the multipart charged by OSS.
