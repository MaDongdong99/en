# Customized domain supports HTTPS access OSS service

## Common Concepts
To associate a customized domain, you need to understand the following concepts:

- User domain, customized domain and the own domain: The domain you purchase from the domain service provider.
- OSS access domain or Bucket domain: The access domain assigned by OSS to your Bucket.

## Customized domain access OSS

After you upload the file to Bucket of JD Cloud OSS, you can use OSS access domain or Bucket domain to access the file. If you want to access these files through a customized domain, you need to associate the customized domain to the bucket where the file is located, and add the CNAME record to the OSS access domain corresponding to the bucket. Refer to [Customized Domain Service](../Operation-Guide/Manage-Bucket/Set-Custom-Domain-Name-2.md).
