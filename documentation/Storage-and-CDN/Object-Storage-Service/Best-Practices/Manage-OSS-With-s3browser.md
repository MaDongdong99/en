### Bucket Operations

**OSS does not support [Server Access Log Management] and [Version Control] in the Bucket Operations. The cross-region replication function cannot be set because the tool can only select bucket of the same region. For [[Image Back-to-origin]](https://docs.jdcloud.com/cn/object-storage-service/manage-origin-retrieval-settings-2) and [[Customized Domain]](https://docs.jdcloud.com/cn/object-storage-service/set-custom-domain-name-2) that are not compatible with S3, please [Go to Console] (https://oss-console.jdcloud.com/space) for settings, some advanced configurations for this tool can be used after they are purchased.**

#### Create Bucket (bucket)

![](../../../../image/Object-Storage-Service/OSS-126.png)

1. Click **New Bucket** to create bucket

![](../../../../image/Object-Storage-Service/OSS-127.png)

2. Enter bucket name in the creation pop-up window

**Description**

* The bucket name is globally unique. If the name is already used by other users, the creation will not succeed. Please follow the [OSS Naming Specification](https://docs.jdcloud.com/cn/object-storage-service/put-bucket -2), and enter the appropriate name that identifies your business.
* When the bucket is created, the default ACL is Private Read/Write. You can change the space access permissions after creation according to your needs. Refer to[[Set Bucket Acl]](Manage-OSS-With-s3browser#user-content-4)
And[[Set Bucket policy]](Manage-OSS-With-s3browser#user-content-5)。

<div id="user-content-4"></div>

#### Set Bucket Acl

##### Operation Steps

1. In the Bucket list, select the bucket name you want to set, right-click and select **edit Permissions(ACL)**. It is shown in the figure below:

![](../../../../image/Object-Storage-Service/OSS-131.png)

2. Complete the settings according to the rules supported by OSS.

##### Only Support Setting Rules:

* Private Read/Write, the corresponding setting is as in the figure:

![](../../../../image/Object-Storage-Service/OSS-128.png)

* Public Read and Private Write, the corresponding setting is as in the figure:

![](../../../../image/Object-Storage-Service/OSS-130.png)

* Public Read/Write, the corresponding setting is as in the figure:

![](../../../../image/Object-Storage-Service/OSS-129.png)

* If you want to implement the refined authorization to other users, you can use JD Cloud IAM to complete the settings through the JD Cloud Console. If you only need to authorize the OSS resources permission for other JD Cloud accounts (including the primary accounts and sub-accounts) and achieve fine-grained flexible authorization, please refer to [Set Bucket policy]

**Description**

When setting up Bucket ACL, it is recommended that you use the OSS Console or SDK Settings, which is more convenient and efficient than using s3browsers.
At the same time, you need to be aware that for OSS, Bucket ACL and Bucket policy, currently you can only manage Bucket permissions through one of them, and they cannot coexist. If set at the same time, s3browsers will report an error and display an exception.

<div id="user-content-5"></div>
