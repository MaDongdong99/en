#### What is OSS?

JD Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS) is a storage service for Internet provided by JD Cloud, providing bulk, safe, low-cost, and highly reliable cloud storage service. It has a platform-independent RESTful API interface and can provide data reliability of 99.999999999% (eleven "9" in total) and service availability of 99.9%. You can store and access any type of data in any application, anytime and anywhere. In order to realize the unified utilization of resources, reduce the difficulty of using and improve the working efficiency, the data are stored in multi-region and cross-cluster.

#### What’s the function of OSS?

OSS provides a simple Web service interface for storing and extracting data of any amount. The developers can easily build application programs that use the Internet to store. At the same time, OSS has a high scalability; users only need to pay according to the actual consumption amount. The developers can back up mass data on the cloud in order to address expansion restriction of the bucket or for data security. They can also start with a small amount and expand application programs as needed without affecting the performance or reliability. Such as the disaster recovery system, content storage and sharing, data analysis and storage, net disk and other applications.
