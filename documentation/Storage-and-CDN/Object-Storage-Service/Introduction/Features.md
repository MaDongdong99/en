| Control OSS Resource Access Permission            | You may control OSS resource access permissions via the method below: <br>ACL: <br>OSS provides the Access Control List (ACL) for permission control. <br>ACL is the access policy granting bucket and object access permission. You can configure ACL in the Console while creating the bucket and modify ACL at any time. <br>Bucket Policy:<br>You can conveniently and visually grant other users to access your OSS resources with the Bucket Policy function of the Console, for example, granting access permission to IAM users of other accounts and granting access permission with specific IP condition restrictions to the anonymous users. <br>IAM Policy:<br>You can build IAM Policy for access permission control of bucket and folder. | [Read and Write Permission ACL-based Permission Control](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/object-storage-service/access-control-base-on-acl)<br>[Bucket Policy-based Permission Control](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/object-storage-service/access-control-base-on-bucket-policy)<br>[IAM Policy-based Permission Control](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/object-storage-service/access-control-base-on-iam-policy) |
| Protect OSS data against hotlinking by others         | When Anti-Leech is set for your bucket, you can enable or disable access request with the blank Referer field by setting the Referer field whitelist.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [Use of Bucket Policy-Setting of Referer White List ](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/object-storage-service/set-bucket-policy-2)                       |
| Access OSS resources by using a customized domain          | You can associate the customized domain (the domain of yourself) to the OSS bucket and then access data in the bucket by using the customized domain. You can associate the customized domain (i.e. the domain of yourself) access to your own Bucket, i.e. CNAME. After you enable the CNAME function, OSS will automatically process access requests to the domain.                                                                                                                                       | [Associate Customized Domain](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/object-storage-service/set-custom-domain-name-2)<br>[OSS Service Access via HTTPS Supported by Customized Domain](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/object-storage-service/custom-domain-name-guidance)                        |
| Access bucket via static web page            | Upon uploading images, videos, static web pages and other resources to OSS Bucket, you can set your bucket in the static website hosting mode and access such static web page via the bucket domain.                                                                                                                                                                                           | [Set Static Website Hosting](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/object-storage-service/set-bucket-website-2)                                           |
| Cross-Origin Resource Sharing                  | OSS provides setting of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in HTML5 protocol. CORS allows interaction between the client Web application program in one domain with resources in another domain.                                                                                                                                                                                         |[Set Cross-origin Resource Sharing](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/object-storage-service/set-bucket-cors-2)                                               |
| Automatically delete objects in specified time           | Manage life cycles of all objects or specific files in the bucket. For example, after a specified number of days have elapsed, delete a specific file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [Manage Object Life Cycle ](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/object-storage-service/lifecycle)                                           |
| Copy data of one bucket in one region to another bucket in another region | Cross-region replication means to automatically and asynchronously replicate objects in buckets in different regions. With the cross-region replication function, object operations, such as creation and update, can be reduplicated to a target bucket in another region.                                                                                                                                                                                            | [Manage Cross-region Replication](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/object-storage-service/set-bucket-cross-region-replication-2)                                            |
