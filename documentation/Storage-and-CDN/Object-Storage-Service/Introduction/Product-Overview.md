# OSS Overview

## OSS Introduction

Object Storage Service (OSS) provides a safe, stable, mass and convenient Object Storage Service for users with JD's rich technological experience in the field of distributed storage. Object Storage Service provides a full range of products including file upload, storage, download, distribution and online processing. From a few bytes to a few terabytes of data, we can offer you a complete storage solution.

The underlying architecture of Object Storage Service is entirely same as the picture storage and order storage system used inside JD. Currently, the system has carried key data of about 200 departments including online store, finance, mobile, logistics, paipai, JD Cloud, Data Department to provide solid security for rapid growing of JD business;

Meanwhile, Object Storage Service also provides you with a simple and convenient Restful interface and easy-used SDK to help you manage and access the data on Object Storage Service in any application, at any time and any place.

## OSS Storage Level
Standard Storage: standard storage provides users with high-reliability, high-availability and high-performance Object Storage Service. Standard storage has low access delay and higher throughput, so it is applicable to the business scenario where large throughput and hotspot files required frequently access, e.g. mobile application, large-scale websites, picture sharing, hotspot audio/video, etc.

Reduced Redundancy Storage: reduced redundancy storage provides users with Object Storage Service of lower storage cost and lower access delay. Compared with standard storage, reduced redundancy storage largely reduces the price of storage, so it is applicable to the business scenario where has low read frequency and data requires long-time cold backup on Object Storage Service; the minimum of storage time is 30 days.
