## OSS storage level
Standard Storage: standard storage provides users with high-reliability, high-availability and high-performance object storage service. Standard storage has low access delay and higher throughput, so it is applicable to the business scenario where has large throughput and hotspot files required frequently access, e.g. mobile application, large-scale websites, picture sharing, hotspot audio/video, etc.

Reduced Redundancy Storage: reduced redundancy storage provides users with object storage service of lower storage cost and lower access delay. Compared with standard storage, reduced redundancy storage largely reduces the price of storage, so it is applicable to the business scenario where has low read frequency and data requires long-time cold backup on object storage service; the minimum of storage time is 30 days.
