## Billing Cases

**Case background 1 (use standard storage)**

Company A is a media enterprise which stores a huge number of picture material files on the Object Storage Service. It adopts standard storage method. There are about 100GB picture files. The monthly Internet downlink traffic of picture files is about 500GB. It does not use CDN acceleration and the number of read or write requests is about 2 million per month.

Cost Composition

Storage capacity cost: 100(GB) * RMB 0.00427/GB/day * 30(days) = RMB12.81

Internet downlink traffic cost: 500(GB) * RMB 0.50/GB = RMB 250.00

Number of request cost: it is free temporarily, if it becomes a charge item, then the cost of this part is 2(million times) / 10000 * unit price/10000 times

Total monthly consumption = storage capacity cost + Internet downlink traffic cost = RMB 12.81 + RMB 250.00 = RMB 262.81

**Case background 2 (use Object Storage Service+CDN)**

Company B is a video website enterprise which stores a huge number of video files on the Object Storage Service. It adopts standard storage method. There are about 200GB video files. In each month, the video files use CDN acceleration, with the CDN Internet traffic being about 4TB, CDN back-to-source traffic being about 800GB (if the files to be accessed are not hit in the CDN nodes, then the files will be fetched from the Object Storage Service by back-to-source) and the number of read or write requests being 5 million.

Cost Composition

Storage capacity cost: 200(GB) * RMB 0.00427/GB/day * 30(days) = RMB 25.62

CDN back-to-source traffic cost: 800(GB) * RMB 0.14/GB = RMB 112.00

CDN public network traffic cost: 4 * 1024(GB) * RMB 0.35/GB = RMB 1433.60

Number of requests cost: it is temporarily free, if it becomes a charge item, then the cost of this part is 5(million times) / 10000  * unit price/10000 times

Total monthly consumption = storage capacity cost + CDN back-to-source cost + CDN public network traffic cost = RMB 25.62 + RMB 112.00 + RMB 1433.60 = RMB 1571.22

**Case background 3 (use reduced redundancy storage)**

Company C is an E-commerce enterprise which stores a huge number of electronic invoice files on the Object Storage Service as cold standby of data. It adopts low frequency access type storage method. There are about 500TB electronic invoice files, with access volume being little. In the current stage, both the Internet downlink traffic and the number of requests may be estimated as 0.

Cost Composition

Storage capacity cost: 500(TB) * 1024 *  RMB 0.00233/GB/day * 30(days) = RMB 35788.80

Internet downlink traffic cost: RMB 0.00

Number of request cost: temporarily free

Total monthly consumption = storage capacity cost + Internet downlink traffic cost = RMB 35788.80 + RMB 0.00 = RMB 35788.80
