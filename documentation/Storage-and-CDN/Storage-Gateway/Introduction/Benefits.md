# Benefits

## Flexible Deployment

Support one-click deployment on the Virtual Machines; provide NFS and FTP file storage protocol, which is applicable to the access of different businesses.

## Install-and-play

Object Storage Service use interface of HTTP Restful while applications or storage system of enterprises usually adopt traditional protocols that cannot directly access Object Storage Service. If you want to use Storage Gateway, you only need create Virtual Machines and configure them as Storage Gateway, which is install-and-play and need no secondary development to attach Object Storage Service as local NFS storage.

## Mass Storage

Storage Gateway provides mass data storage, which implements the separation of cold and hot data through cache mechanism. User can either enjoy the performance of local disk and network to balance access latency, or possess unlimited storage capability at Cloud simultaneously.
