## Protocol Conversion

Though Object Storage Service (OSS) provides high reliable, high expansive and low cost storage service, local applications of traditional enterprises can only use OSS by interface adaption (RESTful API) frequently. With Storage Gateway, you can use OSS just like read-write your local disks (through NFS).

## Accelerate your access

Storage Gateway has the built-in local cache that caches frequently accessed hot data in local and synchronizes the data to Cloud in an asynchronous way. The speed read and write OSS through Storage Gateway usually is superior to that of directly accessing OSS.
