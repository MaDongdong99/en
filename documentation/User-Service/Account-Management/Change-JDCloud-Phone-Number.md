# Manage associated mobile phone or email

(If you are using a JD account, please conduct operation by referring to [JD Account Management](../../../documentation/User-Service/Account-Management/Check-Your-Account.md).)

The mobile phone number and email associated to an account are the safety tools verifying identity of the account operator. In case of sensitive or abnormal operation, verification can be made via a mobile phone number or an email, to guarantee account safety.
The mobile phone number and email are also the main method for receiving JD Cloud’s important notices, such as resource expiration and release, monitoring alarm and other messages. Meanwhile, for the user having only one account in JD Cloud, he/she can log in JD Cloud with the mobile phone number or email associated with the account.

## Firstly associate mobile phone number and email

When a JD Cloud account is registered, one valid mobile phone number shall be filled in and this account will be associated with the mobile phone number after registration.

After successful registration, JD Cloud will guide you to complete an email. If this operation is not made, you can associate an email on the "Account Management - Security Setting" page, as shown in Figure 1. After the email is completed, JD Cloud will send a verification email. After the verification is completed, the account is associated with this email. Before verification, this email is in the "un-verified" status and cannot be used for identity verification or for receiving information, as shown in Figure 2 - Figure 3.
