### View account information

You can view the account information on the page  "[Account Management-Basic Data](https://uc.jdcloud.com/account/basic-info)". The user Pin is the JD account user name and the only identifier of JD account; the account ID is generated by JD Cloud system and some JD Cloud services will use the account ID to implement authorization among accounts, e.g. Identity and Access Management (IAM).

## Disable JD account after upgrade

After the account is upgraded, you can use the account name and password set during the upgrade to directly log in JD Cloud instead of JD login. Because the JD account is attributed to individual, when the employee of the enterprise leaves office or is transferred, the enterprise may need to disable his or her continuous access to the cloud Console.

You can disable or enable again the access to JD account on the page "[Account Management - Security Settings](https://uc.jdcloud.com/account/security-settings)".
