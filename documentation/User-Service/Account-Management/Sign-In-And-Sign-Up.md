### 2. Enter a commonly used mobile phone number, as the security phone number of the account
Please use your regular mobile phone number for verification. The verification code may be sent by SMS or phone call. If the alternative mobile phone number is used for registration, because the network of secondary number is not stable, there may be problems of not receiving SMS or phone calls occasionally. Please wait for a while and try again later.

After successful registration, the phone number will become a security phone number associated to the account, used to receive important notifications from JD Cloud, and as a method of security verification of your account.
