### 2. Enter a commonly used mobile phone number, as the security phone number of the account
Please use your regular mobile phone number for verification. The verification code may be sent by SMS or phone call. If the alternative mobile phone number is used for registration, because the network of secondary number is not stable, there may be problems of not receiving SMS or phone calls occasionally. Please wait for a while and try again later.

After successful registration, the phone number will become a security phone number associated to the account, used to receive important notifications from JD Cloud, and as a method of security verification of your account.
If your mobile phone number is used to subscribe JD Cloud service for the first time, the mobile phone number can be used for account login; if the mobile phone number has been associated with other JD Cloud Account, your mobile phone number cannot be used for login of the account you are currently registering.

If you use your mobile phone number or email for login and a notification "this mobile phone number/email cannot log in", it means that the entered mobile phone number/email has been associated with several accounts in JD Cloud or the associated account does not support login via mobile phone number/email.
