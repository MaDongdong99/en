### FAQ

1. Will resources purchased under the account be affected after account upgrade?
A: No. Functions, including but not limited to resources, services and data in the account, will not be changed, except functions as login and security setting of account.

2. The enterprise account administrator has quitted, but the original JD account is the personal account of the administrator. Can problems of account password change and login failure be solved via upgrade? Is it possible to forbid access to enterprise cloud resources by the quitted staff?
A: After account upgrade, the password of original JD account and that of a new account are different. Enterprises can log in by setting a new account name and a password. However, JD Cloud will not disable the original JD login method by default. If an enterprise needs to disable access via the original JD account, it can open ticket for application. JD Cloud will handle the ticket within one working day and then disable access via JD account.

3. If I do not want any upgrade, what are the influences?
A: Users can still access their accounts from JD’s login entrance via the original JD account whenever. JD Cloud will not change security policies and login rules of original JD account.

4. Is the account registered on official page of JD Cloud a JD account or a new JD Cloud account?
A: Any account registered on official page of JD Cloud before July 18, 2019 is the JD Cloud and can be upgraded to the new JD Cloud account. Since July 18, 2019, the newly-registered accounts are the new JD Cloud account, which will not be associated with a JD account and cannot be used for logging in JD Mall.
