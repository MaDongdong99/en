# Message Management



JD Cloud will inform you of various business messages via intra-website message, SMS and email. You may view intra-website messages in the JD Cloud Console and set how you want to receive SMS and email notifications.

Click on the "Messages" menu (the number displayed on the right side of "Messages" is the number of unread intra-website messages) in the top bar menu of JD Cloud Console, and then enter the Message Management page.

## Message Settings
The **Message Settings** page shows the types of messages sent to you via SMS and email.

Click the **Edit** button next to each “Message Recipient” to set a contact or contact group as the recipient of messages. Please refer to the Contact Management Help Documentation for [how to manage contacts](../../../documentation/User-Service/Message-Center/Contact-Management.md).

The way to send the account "Balance Warning" messages and “Insufficient Balance Reminder" cannot be modified. Such messages and reminders will be sent to your account contact (i.e. yourself) via SMS and email by default; you can set whether to specify contacts or contact groups to receive “Product Messages” via email and SMS.

When setting a recipient for a message, you can select one or more contacts (the default message recipient is the account contact, i.e. yourself), or select one or more contact groups. Contacts and contact groups cannot be selected at the same time.
