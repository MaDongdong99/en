Note: According to the opinions on the registration system reform of the State Council and the relevant requirements for all provinces’ and cities’ accelerating the reform of the "five certificates in one, one unified social credit code for one business license" registration system, various market subjects need to complete the renewal of the "unified social credit code" business license before December 31, 2017. From January 1, 2018, any unrenewed licenses will lose effect, and the operation of their market subjects will be regarded as unlicensed. So, JD Cloud currently only supports that the user completes enterprise real-name verification with the business license loaded with unified social credit code.
