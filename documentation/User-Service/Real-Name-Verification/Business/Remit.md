# Corporate Account Payment Verification
[The JD Cloud page](https://realname.jdcloud.com/account/verify) supports that the enterprise user completes the enterprise real-name verification; meanwhile, if the enterprise real-name verification is completed for your account at [JD Finance Enterprise Station](https://biz.jd.com), you can also complete the one-click synchronization of verification status on the JD Cloud page.

JD Cloud supports two verification methods, which are the payment verification of corporate bank account opened to enterprises and the enterprise legal person face scanning verification, of which the corporate bank account payment verification processes mainly include the following four steps:

 1. Select verification method - corporate account payment verification
 2. Fill in the enterprise name and corporate account information, check and submit after check
 3. Complete the transfer amount verification of corporate account after the enterprise information audit is approved
 4. Pass the enterprise real-name verification

Note: According to the opinions on the registration system reform of the State Council and the relevant requirements for all provinces’ and cities’ accelerating the reform of the "five certificates in one, one unified social credit code for one business license" registration system, various market subjects need to complete the renewal of the "unified social credit code" business license before December 31, 2017. From January 1, 2018, any unrenewed licenses will lose effect, and the operation of their market subjects will be regarded as unlicensed. So, JD Cloud currently only supports that the user completes enterprise real-name verification with the business license loaded with unified social credit code.
