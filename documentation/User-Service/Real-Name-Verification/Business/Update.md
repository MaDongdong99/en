# Process.Overview
[JD Cloud Page](https://realname.jdcloud.com/account/verify) supports that the user having passed the enterprise real-name verification changes the enterprise information under the precondition that the unit subject stays the same (the unified social credit code stays the same). The process of real-name updating is divided into the following five steps:

 1. Select the enterprise type and business license type
 2. Update the enterprise certificate and update the enterprise information
 3 Check and submit the enterprise information
 4. Complete the remittance verification of corporate account after the certificate information is approved
 5. Complete the updating of enterprise real-name information

Note: According to the opinions on the registration system reform of the State Council and the relevant requirements for all provinces’ and cities’ accelerating the reform of the "five certificates in one, one unified social credit code for one business license" registration system, various market subjects need to complete the renewal of the "unified social credit code" business license before December 31, 2017. From January 1, 2018, any unrenewed licenses will lose effect, and the operation of their market subjects will be regarded as unlicensed. Therefore, to enterprise merchants, JD Cloud only supports that the user changes the certificate type into the unified social credit code type and doesn’t allow that the certificate type is changed inversely.
