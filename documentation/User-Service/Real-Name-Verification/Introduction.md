# Real-name Verification
JD Cloud recognizes your personal real-name verification and enterprise real-name verification completed in JD Finance. If you have opened Baitiao business in JD Finance or performed verification in JD Pay (merchant platform), you can authorize JD Cloud to obtain your real-name information. If you have not performed real-name verification, but you need to buy a machine, participate in promotion activities, withdraw deposits normally or get invoices, please complete real-name verification as soon as possible.

 - For individual users, please select **Personal Real-name Verification**, and the account will be under the individual after the verification is completed.
   
 - For enterprise users, please select **Enterprise Real-name Verification**, and the account will be under the enterprise after the verification is completed.

 - Users who have completed personal real-name verification can continue to upgrade enterprise real-name verification to become an enterprise user.

Please select the type of real-name verification carefully according to the nature of your account. If the enterprise account is used to perform personal real-name verification, or the personal account is used as the enterpriseâ€™s verification account, in case of any personnel change, account transfer and account ownership dispute, it may bring you losses, or affect you to withdraw deposits or get invoices.
