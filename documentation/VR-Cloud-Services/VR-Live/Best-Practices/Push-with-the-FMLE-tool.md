### 3.2 Audio and Video Format Setting

Before pushing streaming, we need to set the video and audio format parameters. The left side of the module is video format setting, and the right side is audio format setting. We can select to use audio, video or audio and video at the same time by checking the box in front of video and audio. In the video configuration, we can modify the video input device, frame rate, code rate, encoding mode, input resolution, output resolution and so on.

## 4. Summary

Multiple operating systems of FMLE can be used normally. Single audio, single video
recording and live use are relatively simple. It is suggested to turn off the preview function during the live broadcast so as to reduce the consumption of system resources, but screen capture and other functions will not be supported. It is recommended to use OBS when needing screen capture or live audio and video at the same time,
the performance is better than FMLE, and there are more options in settings.
