# Start pushing streaming

A. Use a pushing streaming tool provided by VR device manufacturer for pushing streaming  
Many VR collection device manufacturers provide live pushing streaming tools. Before pushing streaming, you need to download and install a pushing streaming tool offered by the manufacturer and conduct the pushing streaming according to the operation instructions.

B. Use RTMP server + common pushing streaming tools for pushing streaming  
Link all hardware such as VR collection device, RTMP server on VR Live Streaming site to a LAN and ensure it has access to the external network and meet the uplink bandwidth actually required; and then enable the RTMP server to push the live streaming signals stitched by VR collection device to the RTMP server; finally, use a common pushing streaming tool (e.g. OBS) for pushing streaming.
