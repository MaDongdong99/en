# Purchase Process

JD Cloud VR Live Streaming has completed the development and construction of cloud VR processing capabilities and VR Player SDK so far. As the cloud VR processing function that has been developed can also be used in Live Video services (already integrated into the Live Video product), in order to reduce the cost of customer experience, the VR Live Streaming cloud processing services will be provided through the Console of the Live Video product during the Beta of the product. Therefore, you need to enable the Live Video service if you would like to experience it.   
For the enabling process of Live Video service, refer to "[Live Video Purchase Process](https://github.com/jdcloudcom/cn/blob/edit/documentation/Video-Service/Live-Video/Pricing/Purchase-Process.md)".       
After the official launch of the product, the Console specific for VR Live Streaming will be coming soon.
