### 3.2 Resolution Setting

Click the resolution selection menu in the upper right corner of the software, select the resolution same with the workspace resolution or the resolution in the same scale (the scale in the bracket after the resolution, such as 1280x720-720p (16:9), is 16:9), if you do not have your own resolution or a corresponding scale, you can click the customized resolution in the resolution menu for addition; and if the machine feels the jam during the live broadcast, the resolution can be scaled down.

Note: The live workspace resolution must be consistent with the workspace resolution scale, otherwise the live screen cannot be pulled to the full screen. If the window is live broadcasted, please set the resolution to the same scale as the window.
