## 1. View pushing streaming list

Log in the Live Console, access the "Stream Management" page, click the drop-down box of **Streaming Type** and "Select Domain" in turn, select the pushing streaming domain to be viewed from the domain list and fill in appName and streamName optionally.

## 2. Add to blacklist

If a path streaming has illegal behaviors, you can click **Forbid Pushing Streaming** at the right of the streaming on the "Stream Management". If steam breaking operation is made to stream, stream added in the blacklist will be no longer applicable for pushing streaming and pulling streaming operation
