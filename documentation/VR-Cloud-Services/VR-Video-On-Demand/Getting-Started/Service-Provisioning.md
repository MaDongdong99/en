# Enable Service

JD Cloud VR VOD has completed the development and construction of cloud VR processing capabilities and VR Player SDK so far. As the cloud VR processing function that has been developed can also be used in VOD services (already integrated into the VOD product), in order to reduce the cost of customer experience, the VR VOD cloud processing services will be provided through the Console of the VOD product during the Beta of the product. Therefore, you need to enable the VOD service if you would like to experience it.   
For the enabling process of VOD service, refer to "[VOD Enabling Service](https://github.com/jdcloudcom/cn/blob/edit/documentation/Video-Service/Video-on-Demand/Getting-Started/Service-Provisioning.md)".       
After the official launch of the product, the Console specific for VR VOD will be coming soon.
