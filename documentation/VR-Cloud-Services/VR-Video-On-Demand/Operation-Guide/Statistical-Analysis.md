# Statistics & Analysis

The statistics & analysis is mainly composed of data display from "consumption query" and "data monitoring". Users can query different data for business reference based on their needs.

## 1. Consumption Query

In the consumption query page, users can query data related to consumption such as "traffic bandwidth", "bucket" and "transcoding duration", and screen the data they want to display by virtue of the query conditions in each query item. The specific query conditions and data contents are as below:

|Data Item|Data Content|Query Condition|
|-|-|-|
|Traffic Bandwidth|Traffic Bandwidth Consumption|Domain, Region, Operator, Time Granularity (Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, Customized Time Period)|
|Bucket|Storage Consumption|Time Granularity (Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, Customized Time Period)|
|Transcoding Duration|Transcoding Utilization Duration|Transcoding Specification, Time Granularity (Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, Customized Time Period)|

## 2. Data Monitoring


In the data monitoring page, users can query data related to monitoring such as "UV/PV", "hit ratio" and "status code", and screen the data they want to display by virtue of the query conditions in each query item. The specific query conditions and data contents are as below:

|Data Item|Data Content|Query Condition|
|-|-|-|
|UV/PV|PV and UV Count|Domain, Time Granularity (Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, Customized Time Period)|
|Hit Ratio|Hit Ratio Proportion|Domain, Region, Operator, Time Granularity (Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, Customized Time Period)|
|Status Code|Each Status Code Count (5XX, 4XX, 3XX and 2XX)|Domain, Region, Operator, Time Granularity (Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, Customized Time Period)|
