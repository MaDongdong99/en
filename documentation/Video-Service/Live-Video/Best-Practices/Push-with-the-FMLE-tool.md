## 4. Conclusion

FMLE can be used normally in multiple operation systems, in the mode of separate audio or separate video
Recording and live broadcasting are relatively simple; it is suggested to turn off preview during live broadcasting, so that the consumption of system resources can be reduced; however, it does not support screen capture function and it is suggested to use OBS in case of screen capturing or simultaneous video and audio live broadcasting
whose performance is better than FMLE and with more set options.
