## 1. Pushing Streaming Control  
### Pushing Streaming Authentication Setting  
The function of pushing streaming authentication aims to verify streamer pushing streaming validity, which is provided by the customer’s site to the user for encryption
URL (including permission verification information), users can send requests to the server with the encrypted URL
and the server will verify the permission information contained in the encrypted URL to judge the request validity. Normal response will be given to legal pushing streaming requests, while illegal requests will be denied, so as to effectively protect live contents of the customer’s site.  
First log in the Live Console, Click **Domain Management**, find the live domain group requiring pushing streaming authentication Configuration and click **Management

### Pushing Streaming Authentication Rule  
**Authentication URL Composition**

Authentication URL is consisted by live broadcast pushing streaming address + verification string, and the latter is calculated through md5 algorithm according to authentication key + failure time;
this address is applicable to PC terminal, mobile terminal and third party pushing streaming.

Authentication KEY: The key parameters that the user filled in the authentication settings.

Valid Time: Refers to that the authentication is invalid if the time it takes for user to visit client source server exceeds the self-defined time, for example, the valid time is
1800s, access time that the user has set: 2020-08-15 15:00:00, the true invalid time for the link is: 2020-08-15
15:30:00.

**The composition of encrypted URL for user access**

http:// DomainName/Filename?auth_key=timestamp-rand-uid-md5hash

**Description of Authentication Field**

| **Field**  | **Description**                                                                                                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| timestamp | invalid time, integer positive number, fixed length of 10, seconds since January 1, 1970 for invalid time control, with 10-digit integer andvalid time of 1800s|
| rand      | random numbers, generally set as 0                                                                                        |
| uid       | temporary unused (Set 0 is ok)                                                                         |
| md5hash | validation string calculated according to md5 algorithm, mixture of digits and English letters in lower case 0-9a-z, with fixed length of 32                                   |

**Validation Method**

After getting the request, the server shall judge whether the timestamp in the request is smaller than the current time,
if it is, it shall be regarded as overtime and invalid and HTTP 403 error is returned;
if timestamp is bigger than the current time, construct a same string (refer to the following construction method of sstring).

Then calculate HashValue using MD5 algorithm and compare with md5hash in request;
if the result is consistent, it shall be regarded that the authentication is passed and the file shall be returned or the authentication is a failure and HTTP 403 is returned
Error.

**Example Description **

1.  Request object according to req_auth:

http://[cdn.example.com/sports/football](http://cf.jd.com/cdn.example.com/sports/football)

2.  Key Pair is set as:

jdlivekeyexample123 (user-set)

3.  The expiry date of authentication configuration file is:

00:00:00 on October 10, 2015 and the number of seconds are calculated to be 1444435200

4.  The server shall construct a signature string used for calculating Hashvalue:

/publishDomain/[sports/football](http://cf.jd.com/cdn.example.com/sports/football)-1444435200-0-0-jdlivekeyexample123

5.  The server shall calculate HashValue according to the signature string

HashValue=md5sum("/publishDomain
/[sports/football](http://cf.jd.com/cdn.example.com/sports/football)-1444435200-0-0-jdlivekeyexample123")

=80cd3862d699b7118eed99103f2a3a4f

6.  The URL at request is:

http://[cdn.example.com/](http://cdn.example.com/video/standard/1K.html?auth_key=1444435200-0-0-80cd3862d699b7118eed99103f2a3a4f)[sports/football](http://cf.jd.com/cdn.example.com/sports/football)[?auth_key=1444435200-0-0-80cd3862d699b7118eed99103f2a3a4f](http://cdn.example.com/video/standard/1K.html?auth_key=1444435200-0-0-80cd3862d699b7118eed99103f2a3a4f)

The HashValue calculated is consistent with that md5hash = 80cd3862d699b711

8eed99103f2a3a4f in user request,so the authentication is passed.

### Pushing Streaming IP Blacklist  
The pushing streaming IP blacklist function can be assigned to a specific IP and pushing streaming to the live platform with such function is forbidden.  
If you need to configure the pushing streaming IP blacklist, you can find "Pushing Streaming Control" - "IP Blacklist" on the "IAM" page, and click **Modify Configuration

## 2. Play Control  

### Play Authentication Setting  
The play authentication function aims to protect the customer’s site from being illegally embezzled, and
URL (including permission verification information), users can send requests to the server with the encrypted URL
verify encrypted permission information provided by the customer’s site to the user for encryption and judge request validity. Normal response will be given to legal pushing streaming requests, while illegal requests will be denied, so as to effectively protect live contents of the customer’s site.  
Setting steps of play authentication are as the same as those of pushing streaming authentication.  

### Play Authentication Rule  
 
**Encrypted URL Composition**

http://DomainName/Path/Filename?Parameter&auth_token=expire-uniqid-rand-signature  

signature =md5sum("uri-expire-uniqid-rand-private_key")  

**Authentication Field Description**

| **Field**  | **Description**                                                                                                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| expire | Expiration time, 10-bit integers|
|uniqid    | Integer, random, unique id, set to be 0 when not in use. The field can be used for marking identity or business and the user can set the field on its own   |                                         
|rand      | Integer, random number, set to be 0 in general conditions, using time stamp when producing token as rand                           |
|signature   | Character string, check string worked out with the md5 algorithm, mixture of numbers and lowercase English letters 0-9a-z, with fixed length of 32, case insensitive|
|uri   | It is the relative address of the user’s request object, excluding parameters.|
|private_key  | Secrete key customized by the user (8-32 characters).|  

**Principle Description**  

When the CDN server gets the request, it will judge if expire in the request is before the current time. If yes, it is deemed as expired and the HTTP 403 error will be returned. If expire is later than the current time, a same character string will be constituted (refer to the following signature constitution method). Then, work out the new_signature with the MD5 algorithm and compare the new_signature with the signature in the request. Authentication is passed if the comparison results are consistent and the file will be returned. Otherwise, authentication is failed and the HTTP 403 error will be returned.  

new_signature is worked by computing the following character strings:  

origin_signature = "uri-expire-uniqid-rand-private_key " (uri is the relative address of the user’s request object, excluding parameters)  

new_signature = md5sum(origin_ signature)  

**Example Description**  

Allow the request target:  
http://cdn.example.com/video/standard/1K.html?fa=121&jd=121  

The key is set to be: jdcloud1234 (set by the user)  

The authentication configuration file is expired on June 18, 2020, 00:00:00, equaling to 1592409600 seconds by computing  

The CDN server will constitute a signature character used for computing signature  

/video/standard/1K.html-1592409600-0-0-jdcloud1234  

The CDN server will compute the signature according to character strings of the signature:  
signature = md5sum("/video/standard/1K.html-1592409600-0-0-jdcloud1234") =06d97bc9e43ded48d991994006cfa127  

url at the request is:  
http://cdn.example.com/video/standard/1K.html ?fa=121&jd=121&auth_token=1592409600-0-0-06d97bc9e43ded48d991994006cfa127  

The signature worked out is consistent with the value of signature =06d97bc9e43ded48d991994006cfa127 in the user’s request, thus the authentication is passed.
