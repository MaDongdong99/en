# Live Broadcast Authentication

Authentication function aims to protect content and resources on user's site from being illegally downloaded and pirated and it is provided to user for URL encryption (including permission validation information) by client station;
user initiates a request to server using encrypted URL and server verifies the permission information in the encrypted URL to determine the validity of the request,
it responds normally to the legal request and refuses the illegal request so that the resources in the client station can be protected effectively.

##1. Authentication Settings

Log in the live broadcast console and go to the "Domain Name Management" page; select the group of domain names for which broadcast address is required to be checked and click "Management" on the right to go to the Domain Name Configuration page; click "Authentication Configuration" to switch to the "Authentication Configuration" page and

slide the slide knob on the right side of pushing streaming authentication to open authentication function and it is now only supporting pushing streaming authentication;

fill in the corresponding parameters and click "OK" to finish the authentication settings

## 2. Authentication Instructions

**Authentication URL Composition**

Authentication URL is consisted by live broadcast pushing streaming address + verification string, and the latter is calculated through md5 algorithm according to authentication key + failure time;
this address is applicable to PC terminal, mobile terminal and third party pushing streaming.

Authentication KEY: The key parameters that the user filled in the authentication settings.

Valid Time: Refers to that the authentication is invalid if the time it takes for user to visit client source server exceeds the self-defined time, for example, the valid time is
1800s, access time that the user has set: 2020-08-15 15:00:00, the true invalid time for the link is: 2020-08-15
15:30:00.

**The composition of encrypted URL for user access**

http://DomainName/Filename?auth_key=timestamp-rand-uid-md5hash

**Description of Authentication Field**

| **Field**  | **Description**                                                                                                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| timestamp | invalid time, integer positive number, fixed length of 10, seconds since January 1, 1970 for invalid time control, with 10-digit integer andvalid time of 1800s|
| rand      | random numbers, generally set as 0                                                                                        |
| uid       | temporary unused (Set 0 is ok)                                                                         |
| md5hash | validation string calculated according to md5 algorithm, mixture of digits and English letters in lower case 0-9a-z, with fixed length of 32                                   |

**Validation Method**

After getting the request, the server shall judge whether the timestamp in the request is smaller than the current time,
if it is, it shall be regarded as overtime and invalid and HTTP 403 error is returned;
if timestamp is bigger than the current time, construct a same string (refer to the following construction method of sstring).

Then calculate HashValue using MD5 algorithm and compare with md5hash in request;
if the result is consistent, it shall be regarded that the authentication is passed and the file shall be returned or the authentication is a failure and HTTP 403 is returned
Error.

**Example Description **

1.  Request object according to req_auth:

http://[cdn.example.com/sports/football](http://cf.jd.com/cdn.example.com/sports/football)

2.  Key Pair is set as:

jdlivekeyexample123 (user-set)

3.  The expiry date of authentication configuration file is:

00:00:00 on October 10, 2015 and the number of seconds are calculated to be 1444435200

4.  The server shall construct a signature string used for calculating Hashvalue:

/publishDomain/[sports/football](http://cf.jd.com/cdn.example.com/sports/football)-1444435200-0-0-jdlivekeyexample123

5.  The server shall calculate HashValue according to the signature string

HashValue=md5sum("/publishDomain
/[sports/football](http://cf.jd.com/cdn.example.com/sports/football)-1444435200-0-0-jdlivekeyexample123")

=80cd3862d699b7118eed99103f2a3a4f

6.  The URL at request is:

http://[cdn.example.com/](http://cdn.example.com/video/standard/1K.html?auth_key=1444435200-0-0-80cd3862d699b7118eed99103f2a3a4f)[sports/football](http://cf.jd.com/cdn.example.com/sports/football)[?auth_key=1444435200-0-0-80cd3862d699b7118eed99103f2a3a4f](http://cdn.example.com/video/standard/1K.html?auth_key=1444435200-0-0-80cd3862d699b7118eed99103f2a3a4f)

The HashValue calculated is consistent with that md5hash = 80cd3862d699b711

8eed99103f2a3a4f in user request,so the authentication is passed.
