# Core Concepts

**File Format**

The file format usually includes MP4, AVI, MKV, WMV, MPG, FLV, etc. Videos with different formats have different image qualities, compression standards, as well as different adaption degrees for terminal play. FLV format is widely used in network video due to its relatively small file size and fast loading speed. Video with MP4 format is the most common video format, which has strong compatibility with various types of terminals.

**Code Rate**

Code rate refers to data traffic that a video file consumes per unit of time, which is also called as code stream or code stream rate, and it is the most important part of picture quality control in video encoding. The unit of measurement is "bit per second" (bit/s or bps), but Kbps (the number of thousands of bits per second) or Mbps is often used.

**Resolution**

Resolution refers to the count of pixels in one frame of picture, e.g., 1,280x720, which determines the fine extent of video picture details. In general, the higher the resolution of video, the more pixels it contains and the clearer the picture will be.

**Frame Rate**

Frame rate refers to a unit of measurement for video display frames per unit of time, i.e., count of images refreshed per second.

**Transcoding**

Video transcoding refers to converting source video stream into several video streams with different resolutions, code rates and frame rates to fit to different network bandwidths, terminal handling abilities and requirements of users.

**Encapsulation Conversion**

Encapsulation conversion refers to converting encapsulated formats of videos or audios, e.g., when FLV video is converted into MP4, the compressed video and audio code streams are directly obtained from one encapsulated format file and packaged as another encapsulated format file other than encoding and decoding the video and audio during the process.
