## 1. Pushing Streaming Control  
### Pushing Streaming Authentication Setting  
The function of pushing streaming authentication aims to verify streamer pushing streaming validity, which is provided by the customer’s site to the user for encryption
URL (including permission verification information), users can send requests to the server with the encrypted URL
and the server will verify the permission information contained in the encrypted URL to judge the request validity. Normal response will be given to legal pushing streaming requests, while illegal requests will be denied, so as to effectively protect live contents of the customer’s site.  
First log in the Live Console, Click **Domain Management**, find the live domain group requiring pushing streaming authentication Configuration and click **Management

### Pushing Streaming Authentication Rule  
**Composition of Authentication URL**  

Authentication URL is composed of live pushing streaming address + check string. Check string is calculated by md5 algorithm according to authentication key + expiration time.
This address is applicable to PC, mobile and third-party pushing streaming.

Authentication KEY: KEY parameters filled in authentication configuration by the user.

Valid time: means that this authentication will expire if the time when a user's access time to customer origin server exceeds the customized time (**timestamp** field is designated), for example, if the valid time is
1800s and the access time set by the user is: 2020-08-15 15:00:00, the link will actually expire on: 2020-08-15
15:30:00。

**User Access Encrypted URL Composition**

http:// DomainName/Filename?auth_key=timestamp-rand-uid-md5hash

**Authentication Field Description**

| **Field**  | **Description**                                                                                                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| timestamp | Expiration Time, Positive Integral Number, Fixed Length 10, Seconds Since January 1, 1970. Used to Control Expiration Time, 10 Integers, Valid Time 1800s |
| rand      | Random number, set as 0 generally                                                                                        |
| uid       | Not use currently (set as 0)                                                                                  |
| md5hash   | Check string worked out with the md5 algorithm, mixture of numbers and lowercase English letters 0-9a-z, with fixed length of 32                                   |

**Verification Method**

When the server gets the request, it will judge if timestamp in the request
is before the current time. If yes, it is deemed as expired and the HTTP 403 error will be returned. If deadline is later than the current time,
a same character string will be constituted (refer to the following sstring constitution method).

Then, work out the HashValue with the MD5 algorithm and compare it with the md5hash in the request.
Authentication is passed if the comparison results are consistent and the file will be returned, otherwise, authentication is failed and the HTTP 403 error will be returned.
Error.

**Example Description**

1. Allow req_auth request target:

http:// cdn.example.com/sports/football

2. The key is set as:

jdlivekeyexample123 (set by the user)

3. Authentication configuration file is expired on:

October 10, 2015, 00:00:00, amounting to 1444435200 seconds by computing

4. Server will constitute a signature character string used for computing Hashvalue:

/publishDomain/sports/football-1444435200-0-0-jdlivekeyexample123

5. Server will compute HashValue according to this signature character string

HashValue=md5sum("/publishDomain
/sports/football-1444435200-0-0-jdlivekeyexample123")

=80cd3862d699b7118eed99103f2a3a4f

6. url at the request is:

http:// cdn.example.com/sports/football?auth_key=1444435200-0-0-80cd3862d699b7118eed99103f2a3a4f

The authentication is passed if the HashValue worked out is consistent with the value of md5hash = 80cd3862d699b711

8eed99103f2a3a4f in the user’s request.

### Pushing Streaming IP Blacklist  
The pushing streaming IP blacklist function can be assigned to a specific IP and pushing streaming to the live platform with such function is forbidden.  
If you need to configure the pushing streaming IP blacklist, you can find "Pushing Streaming Control"-"IP Blacklist" on the "IAM" page, and click "Modify Configuration"

## 2. Play Control  

### Play Authentication Setting  
The play authentication function aims to protect the customer’s site from being illegally embezzled, and
URL (including permission verification information), users can send requests to the server with the encrypted URL
verify encrypted permission information provided by the customer’s site to the user for encryption and judge request validity. Normal response will be given to legal pushing streaming requests, while illegal requests will be denied, so as to effectively protect live contents of the customer’s site.  
Setting steps of play authentication are as the same as those of pushing streaming authentication.  

### Play Authentication Rule  
 
**Encrypted URL Composition**

http://DomainName/Path/Filename? Parameter &auth_token=expire-uniqid-rand-signature  

signature =md5sum("uri-expire-uniqid-rand-private_key")  

**Authentication Field Description**

| **Field**  | **Description**                                                                                                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| expire | Expiration time, 10-bit integers|
|uniqid    | Integer, random, unique id, set to be 0 when not in use. The field can be used for marking identity or business and the user can set the field on its own   |                                         
|rand      | Integer, random number, set to be 0 in general conditions, using time stamp when producing token as rand                           |
|signature   | Character string, check string worked out with the md5 algorithm, mixture of numbers and lowercase English letters 0-9a-z, with fixed length of 32, case insensitive|
|uri   | It is the relative address of the user’s request object, excluding parameters|
|private_key  | Secrete key customized by the user (8-32 characters).|  

**Principle Description**  

When the CDN server gets the request, it will judge if expire in the request is before the current time. If yes, it is deemed as expired and the HTTP 403 error will be returned. If expire is later than the current time, a same character string will be constituted (refer to the following signature constitution method). Then, work out the new_signature with the MD5 algorithm and compare the new_signature with the signature in the request. Authentication is passed if the comparison results are consistent and the file will be returned. Otherwise, authentication is failed and the HTTP 403 error will be returned.  

new_signature is worked by computing the following character strings:  

origin_signature = "uri-expire-uniqid-rand-private_key " (uri is the relative address of the user’s request object, excluding parameters)  

new_signature = md5sum(origin_ signature)  

**Example Description**  

Allow the request target:  
http://cdn.example.com/video/standard/1K.html?fa=121&jd=121  

The key is set to be: jdcloud1234 (set by the user)  

The authentication configuration file is expired on June 18, 2020, 00:00:00, equaling to 1592409600 seconds by computing  

The CDN server will constitute a signature character used for computing signature  

/video/standard/1K.html-1592409600-0-0-jdcloud1234  

The CDN server will compute the signature according to character strings of the signature:  
signature = md5sum("/video/standard/1K.html-1592409600-0-0-jdcloud1234") =06d97bc9e43ded48d991994006cfa127  

url at the request is:  
http://cdn.example.com/video/standard/1K.html ?fa=121&jd=121&auth_token=1592409600-0-0-06d97bc9e43ded48d991994006cfa127  

The signature worked out is consistent with the value of signature =06d97bc9e43ded48d991994006cfa127 in the user’s request, thus the authentication is passed.
