# Statistics & Analysis

Statistics & Analysis mainly include data display of "Consumption Query", "Data Monitoring" so that different data can be searched according to demands as business reference.

## 1. Consumption Query

Data of "Traffic Bandwidth", "Bucket", "Transcoding Duration" with respect to the consumption can be searched on Consumption Query page, meanwhile, you can filter the data you want to display through the search conditions for each search item. Specific search conditions and data content for each item are as follows:

|Data Item|Data Content|Search Condition|
|-|-|-|
|Traffic Bandwidth|Traffic Bandwidth Consumption|Domain, Region, Operator, Time Granularity (recent 7 days, recent 30 days, customized period)|
|Bucket|Storage Consumption|Time Granularity (recent 7 days, recent 30 days, customized period)|
|Transcoding Duration|Transcoding Consumption Duration|Transcoding Specifications, Time Granularity (recent 7 days, recent 30 days, customized period)|

## 2. Data Monitoring


Data of "UV/PV", "Hit Ratio", "Status Code" with respect to monitoring can be searched on Data Monitoring page, meanwhile, you can filter the data you want to display through the search conditions for each search item. Specific search conditions and data content for each item are as follows:

|Data Item|Data Content|Search Condition|
|-|-|-|
|UV/PV|Count of PV and UV|Domain, Time Granularity (recent 7 days, recent 30 days, customized period)|
|Hit Ratio|Hit Ratio Proportion|Domain, Region, Operator, Time Granularity (recent 7 days, recent 30 days, customized period)|
|Status Code| Count of Status Codes (5XX, 4XX, 3XX, 2XX)|Domain, Region, Operator, Time Granularity (recent 7 days, recent 30 days, customized period)|
