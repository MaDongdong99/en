### Billing Instructions
•	Payment Method: Pay-As-You-Go  
•	Billing rules: Billing is based on encoding method, resolution of transcoding request and duration of transcoding output file, taking every day as billing period.  
•	Billing period: Billing is based on day. The billing period is from 0:00 to 24:00. The billing time stamp of effective date is the completion time of transcoding task, e.g., transcoding is submitted at 23:00 on the day and completed at 0:05 on the next day, then it will be included in the billing period of next day. Settlement, bill output and deduction for cost generated on previous day will be conducted at 12:00 a.m. to 18:00 p.m. every day.  
•	Output duration: Billing of each transcoding output file is based on minute. The file duration is accurate to two decimal places, wherein the second digit is rounded off according to the third digit, and the duration less than 1 second is calculated as 0.02 minutes.  
•	Output specification determination: The long side and short side of the output video resolution are determined according to the range defined by the output specification, and the formula is shown as follows:  
Taking an example of outputting specification of HD (1280 x 720) or below, the outputting video with its long side of resolution not be greater than 1280 and that of short side not be greater than 720 belongs to this output specification.
If the long side of the output video is greater than 1280 or the short side of the output video is greater than 720, the output video belongs to a higher output specification.  
•	Billing Formula:
The output file duration of video transcoding (minute) x video transcoding unit price of different coding methods and resolutions (RMB/minute)
### Billing Instance
E.g., you used VOD transcoding service on June 18 to transcode the video of 2560 x 1440 of resolution and 100 minutes of duration by encoding method of H.264, then the transcoding cost you needed to pay on June 19 is shown as below:  
Video transcoding output file duration (100 minutes) x video transcoding unit price of different coding methods and resolutions (RMB 0.1/minute) = RMB 10
## c. Video Acceleration
### Charging Items

•	Billing formula: Downlink traffic of VOD (GB) x daily traffic tiered unit price (RMB/GB)    
•	If your monthly consumption amount is more than RMB 100,000, you can use the monthly 95 bandwidth peak billing method provided by CDN.   
### Billing Instance
E.g., you used VOD Acceleration Service with downlink traffic to be 100GB on June 18, then the VOD traffic cost you needed to pay on June 19 is shown as below:  
Downlink traffic of VOD (100GB) x daily traffic tiered unit price (RMB 0.15/GB) = RMB 15
