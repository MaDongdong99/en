**Q: Can the streamer advance the pushing streaming to commission the live room picture?**

A: Yes. After the streamer creates the live room, the streamer can conduct a test on pushing streaming one hour ahead at most, but the live streaming is only available for the play end until the prescribed time. At that time, the live room status is still "preview".

**Q: If the network is poor during the pushing streaming, can I push the streaming again when the live streaming is interrupted?**

A: Yes, but there is a time limit. During the pushing streaming by the streamer, in case of network jitter or change of a pushing streaming mobile phone, the live streaming is allowed to interrupt for 5 minutes at most and the streamer can continue the pushing streaming again by scanning the QR code within 5 minutes; beyond 5 minutes, the live streaming will be changed to "End" status. At the end of the live room, the pushing streaming address and the watch address will become invalid.  

**Q: Can I do the shopping through the shared page at preview, end and expiration status of live streaming?**

A: Yes. The shopping links in the live streaming are irrelevant to the live streaming status. You can do the shopping as long as the live streaming cards shared have a commodity.  

**Q: What does "Expired" mean for the live room?**

A: After you create the live room, you need to push the live streaming within 1 hour after the start time at latest.
