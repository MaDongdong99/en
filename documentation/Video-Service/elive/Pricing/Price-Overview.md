    <td colspan=3>Note: The watch duration in the quote is the sum of accumulated watch time by all audiences during the live streaming.<br/>
For example, if there is a 120-minute live and the audiences are constantly maintained at 1,000 persons, then the total watch duration of a single live =120*1,000=120,000 minutes (in an actual live, audiences will enter or exit midway, which will not be included in the watch duration). As per this calculation, 2 million minutes can provide 16.6 times of live streaming.</td>

### Examples of Scenarios
If there is a 120-minute live, the audiences are constantly maintained at 1,000 persons, the average transaction value is RMB 200, the ordering conversion rate is 20%, and the streamer commission is 10%, 

then the total watch duration of a single live =120*1,000=120,000 minutes 

the live streaming price of a single live = 120,000 minutes * RMB 0.003 =RMB 360 

the volume of trade of a single live = 1,000*200*20%=RMB 40,000 

and the streamer's revenue is RMB 4,000
