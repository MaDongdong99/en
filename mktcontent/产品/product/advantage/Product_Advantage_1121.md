		"proGood":"Excellent Performance",
		"proName":"The enterprise-level GPU is adopted, which has high parallel capacity, high throughout, low delay, high-performance computing, graphic render and floating-point computing capacity. It can easily handle the high real-time and high-concurrency massive computing scenarios, meeting scientific computing scenario requirements of graphic image scenarios, deep learning and training, reasoning, etc.",
		"proDiff":"For the non-professional server configuration, it is hard to unify the device type; it is difficult to play the extreme hardware performance; the purchase cost is very high; and it needs a lot of inventories to meet the expansion demand."

	{
		"proGood":"Simple and Easy to Use",
		"proName":"Obtain GPU computing cluster on-line, make automatic deployment, perfectly connect to JD Cloud products and provide 7X24h all-around operation and maintenance, making you really focus on the core business.",
		"proDiff":"It needs to purchase the device on one’s own and the purchase period is very long. The one-time CAPEX investment is too high and the resource utilization is unbalanced; the professional operation and maintenance team is equipped; the manual disaster tolerance is required; and both the time and effort are required."
