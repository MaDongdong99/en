		"proGood":"Usability",
		"proName":"Modeling experiments can be carried out by dragging and dropping components to integrate sophisticated machine learning algorithms into algorithm components in any combination. Therefore, only simple adjustment of parameters is required to build a model, and user threshold is greatly lowered. ",
