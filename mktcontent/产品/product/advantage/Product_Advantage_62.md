		"proName":"<strong>Auto scaling instances without manual intervention</strong><br>\n Auto Scaling automatically and dynamically creates and releases the VM instances in real time according to the workloads, facilitating services with the most appropriate number of instances without manual intervention and manual deployment. <br>\n The new VM instances can be directly associated with the existing Load Balancer, so that the new instances of scaling group can assume distribution flow and improve service availability.",
		"proDiff":"<strong>Manual Operation</strong><br>\n Manual monitoring of resources, creation and release of resource instances may easily cause erro due to the tedious operation, and real-time manual operation and maintenance of the resource pool is needed based on the service fluctuations, manual operation and maintenance at fixed time is still needed even with the pre-judged service peak value, generating higher costs."

		"proName":"<strong>Appropriate Instance Scaling and Cost Reduction</strong><br>\n Auto Scaling facilitates services with the most appropriate number of instances. It automatically adds an appropriate number of VM instances on increased service demands while reduces unnecessary VM instances on decreased service demands, thus guaranteeing the availability of VM instances on demand, improving resource utilization rate and effectively reducing the cost of deployment and instances.",
		"proDiff":"<strong>Waste Caused by Idling Resources </strong><br>\n Redundant Virtual Machines need to be prepared in advance so as not to affect the service due to insufficient resources during peak hours, thus wasting the resource costs."
