		"proGood":"Low Cost",
		"proName":"It configures, runs, extends JCS for Redis without operations such as machine installation, and deployment, operation and maintenance of the database. It has features like resource monitoring and stability maintenance so as to reduce daily maintenance workloads.",
		"proDiff":"Need to set up corresponding services by special personnel; it is time-consuming and labor-consuming, with high manpower costs."
	},
	{
		"proGood":"High Availability",
		"proName":"The pair hot standby mode realizes automatic switch. When a fault occurs on the master node, the slave node is upgraded to become the new master node to provide services continuously; the persistent service data and instance allocation across availability zones ensure data security and continuous operation of services.",
		"proDiff":"Install and configure the master-slave node, guarantee the operation of redis service, and depend on the technicianâ€™s database management level"
	},
	{
		"proGood":"Smooth Expansion",
		"proName":"The one-key expansion is convenient and quick. Elastic expansion can be performed based on the usage, which can be selected and upgraded based on demands so as to improve resource utilization rate and lower redundancy cost; You can log in the console to perform expansion, the whole process will not affect your on-line business.",
		"proDiff":"After exceeding the capacity threshold value, it needs to create enough resources, interrupt the application connection and migrate the data. This process will influence normal business access. Long expansion period and low resource utilization rate"
	},
	{
		"proGood":"High Performance",
		"proName":"The memory is used to store data. Performance much higher than the relational database is provided through characteristics of low latency and high throughput of Redis engine; the protection at the source code level and ultra-high performance are able to satisfy your requirements on most scenarios; it supports most Redis commands and easily copes with business demands on Redis high capacity or high performance; it provides cluster type extended Redis performance and breaks the performance bottleneck of the Redis single-threaded mechanism.",
		"proDiff":"Need to research the core code and solve the issues of development, maintenance and high-speed cache"
	},
	{
		"proGood":"High Capacity",
		"proName":"Massive storage and unlimited capacity. The cluster version adopts a distributed architecture; the data is distributed on multiple physical machines; the physical restriction of single machines is broken; and the bottleneck of massive data storage on Redis is solved.",
		"proDiff":"Limited by physical memory, need to solve the capacity and stability issues independently"
	},
	{
		"proGood":"Monitor Alarm",
		"proName":"Various types of monitoring are provided for users, including a variety of monitoring of amount of usage, number of connections, QPS and number of Key, etc., with the aim to display the visual data monitoring. The all-link monitoring and early warning can assist you in giving an early warning, prompting risks and quickly positioning and solving problems in advance.",
		"proDiff":"Need to develop the monitoring system independently; the operation and maintenance personnel shall stand by at any time."
