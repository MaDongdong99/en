		"proGood":"High Reliability",
		"proName":"Raft is introduced to realize the high reliability of data, the data are synchronously written and the data in 3 copies are backed up, with the data reliability of up to 99.999999%, and the default messages can be persistently stored for 3 days and the message at any time point consumed by a consumer ID in 3 days can be reset.",

		"proGood":"High Performance",
		"proName":"Ten million-level of messages can be received, sent and notified per second, without concurrency restrictions, and a huge number of messages are accumulated, with the upper limit of capacity, and the writing delay of messages is controlled within 10ms.",
		"proDiff":"Data reliability and performance cannot be satisfied with low cost."

		"proGood":"Smooth Expansion",
		"proName":"To meet the requirements for messaging between workloads, the number of Topic can be expanded elastically and the scale of cluster can be elastically scalable, which is completely transparent to users, and the on-demand billing is adopted, the resource utilization is improved and the costs for redundancy are reduced.",
		"proDiff":"Need to create new resource, disconnect application connection and migrate the data after reaching the performance bottleneck; in this process, normal business access will be influenced. Long expansion period and low resource utilization rate"
