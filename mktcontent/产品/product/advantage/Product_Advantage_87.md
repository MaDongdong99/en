		"proName":"JD Cloud NLB can monitor the business flow. When page views increase rapidly, it extends the NLB service instance automatically, supports the simultaneous flow eruption at a one hundred million level, and has the ability to process the million-level new connections per second; when page views decrease, it automatically contracts NLB service instances and reduces resource consumption. The whole scaling course is performed automatically and smoothly, supporting session persistence, insensible and smooth user service.",
		"proDiff":"When the business growth reaches the bottleneck of hardware, it needs to re-purchase the devices with higher performance, with tedious installation. More seriously, it even needs to interrupt the business for artificial dilatation, with a long dilatation period and high manpower costs."
